# Sprint Challenge: Computer Security and Theory of Computation

- [Improve your practical personal security](security/)
- [Theory of Computation](theory/)

# Security Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

- [ ] Create File: `ThreatModel.md`.
- [ ] Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go).
- [ ] Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters).
- [ ] Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance).
- [ ] Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption).

# Security Part 2 - Practical Security: Do something to improve your personal security setup

- [x] Create File: `PracticalSecurity.md`.
- [x] Set Up Password Manager.
- [x] Pick a suitably long _passphrase_ to protect your password manager.
- [x] Set Up 2 Factor Authentication.
- [ ] Set up proper SSH keypairs for services that support it (e.g. GitHub).
- [x] Summarize in file:`PracticalSecurity.md` with 1-2 paragraphs.

# Theory of Computation: Regular Expressions

- [x] Single regex.
- [x] Regex that matches either of.
- [x] Dates Regex.

# Theory of Computation: State Machines

- [x] Draw a state machine that corresponds to the following regex: ab\*c+d?[ef]
- [x] Lion State Machine
- [x] The VT-100 terminal (console) [ ESC[12;45f ESC[1m ]
