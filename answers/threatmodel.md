- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

To Whom It May Concern:

    As a developer at this fine company I feel obligated to both inform and warn you that our app is subject to attack. The average anticipated user of our app will be of a "certain age". This alone will make us a target for theives.

    The attack surface will be quite large and all encompassing. The app exposes a significant amount of personal information accross the board. I've asked Jim to go ahead and pay for an audit so we don't end up on the news.

    Moving forward, I think immediately we need to start hashing and encrypting personal data at the very least, forcing passwords to expire and change and requiring some sort of 2FA immediately.

    Thanks, I hope to hear from management soon.
