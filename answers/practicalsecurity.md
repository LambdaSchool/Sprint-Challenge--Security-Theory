# I did nothing for additional practical security.

I was already bitlocker (MS) to fully encrypt my HD. I was also using VeraCrypt as a secondary encryption for private repos. I use PWGen to generate very large and complex passwords along with KeepPass and Windows Hello for 2FA fingerprint for physical access and my Google, MS, and Amazon accounts are all 2FA with time changing one time passwords(via my phone). Github and Bitbucket have also been SSH Key only for a long time which I have automated for multiple accounts via WSL Arch Linux (also on full encryption mode).
