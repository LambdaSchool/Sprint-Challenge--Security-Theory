Cyber security continues to be a very real threat, and in order to mitigate risk of potential attacks, we must remain vigilant of our behavior around technology. The following four focal points will aid in this endevour and act as our mental foundation with respect to cyber security:

  0. **ADVERSARIES** are the individual(s) with malicious intent to get past your security protocals. It's important to be aware of what type of people may be interested in the information you're exposed to. Who stands to gain the most in the event of a data breach? We need to consider our competitors, enemies, and internal threats.

  1. **ATTACK SURFACE** refers to the variables in our work environment - such as our software/hardware and internal/external security protocals - that make us prone to attacks. 
    - What protocals do we have in place for offsite meetings?
    - Is there anything we can improve on internally?
    - Are there any known issues with the software/hardware we utilize?  

  2. **ATTACK VECTORS** represent the various methods that an attacker can compromise our current security protocals. For example, if you use the same password for all of your work accounts, an attacker only needs to crack the least protected software/hardware to gain access to the most sensitive material. 

  3. **MITIGATIONS:** How can we mitigate the risk of an attack?
    - Logging out of all security portals prior to leaving your work environment.
    - Never giving critical information over insecure channels.
    - Staying up to date with firewall updates.
    - Never taking work materials home.
    - Never use the same password more than once.
