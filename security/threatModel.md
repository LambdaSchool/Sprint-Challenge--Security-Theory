Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)
Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file ThreatModel.md with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise fashion.

Hi Bob,

I wanted to talk to you about working from cafes. There are many negative effects of this and I have talked to management about this. However, I wanted to personally talk to you about it before I bring it up at our next board meeting.

One of the biggest issues with working from cafes is potential increase of area in attack surface. for example, accessing our codebase from a public WIFI means our user data and sensitive information would be at the mercy of the security of the WIFI which we cannot control.

Given that a lot software companies use our platform for storing their data, which makes us a high value target, an adversary would want to access our data in order to exploit any vulnerability. In an event that an adversary breaches our system, it could be devastating to our reputation and brand. This could mean that our customer may look to elsewhere for security.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I hope management would take actions on this in order to eliminate the possibility of this scenario.

Sincerely,

David
