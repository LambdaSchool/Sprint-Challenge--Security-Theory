Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

### Attack Surface
Attack surface is part of system which exposed for user and security vulnerabilities. Hackers can attack the system through attack surfaces.

### Adversaries
Adversaries are attackers who attempt to discover or corrupt data and system

### Attack Vectors
Attack vectors are pathways which attackers use to gain access or exploit system vulnerabilities. For example, unlocked computer, spam email, etc.

### Mitigations
Mitigations are solutions to limit/reduce security risks. For example, keep computer locked when going away, setup spam mail filter
