- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)

input fields for website's login
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
individuals interested in stealing credit card information
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
password theft via SQL injections or keyloggers, password cracking via brute force
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)
change to a more secure database, add proper input filtering, add captchas for protection against brute force hacking

This website is has security vulnerabilities that must be fixed. Failure to do so will result in risking valuable client information to be stolen. This type of information includes usernames, passwords, and credit card information. Primary adversaries include individuals seeking to steal credit card information. Primary attack surface is the input field on the website's login page. Attack vectors include password theft via SQL injection, or password cracking via brute force methods. It will be necessary to mitigate all risk of losing client data through implementing regex to filter scripts from being ran from the input boxes, and adding capchcas to prevent brute force login programs.
