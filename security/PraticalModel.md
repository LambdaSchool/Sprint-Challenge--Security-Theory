I have connected SSH keys to my github account to secure my password and account on github. I have also connected a SSH key to my gitlab account to ensure my account with gitlab is secure. SSH keys are based on ryptographic network protocol which is responsible for the encryption of the information stream between me and the remote machine. This is important for me to ensure not only that my info is safe and the and crytped when I am using gitgub and git lab to push up code. I have to ensure that I my infor is not easily compromised and that the information ends up in the correct repo and not anywhere public. I was able to do this by running some simple command gitbash command line. By genertaring a piblic key, by runninng '''ssh-keygen''', a publick key is generated for you to connect your account. This extra level of protection gives you more peace of mind and secruity but there are is even more you can do!
