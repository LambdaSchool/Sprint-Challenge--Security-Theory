I updated several accounts' passwords that were too generic. I utilized a local password container and its' built-in password generator. This generator allows to choose a password length, the types of characters you prefer, an option to exclude similar characters, and an options to use characters for every character group. Once I updated an account password, I saved the updated account information in a virtual vault.
