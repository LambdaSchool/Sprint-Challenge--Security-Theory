To improve my security, I use different methods of authentication. For my email addresses, in order to sign in, my service provider sends an alert to my phone, and my phone also requires a thump print to access it, after phone when phone authentication is done, then I authorize login for email. I also use Free Password Manager App LastPast, which I use to change my password every three months.
