Eric is a bio engineer working on DNA modifying technology. his work entails using this tech to make mutant becteria that act as a herbicide! his work his highly contervartial because of the recent back lash against GMO. eric frequently recieves angry emails! eric uses third party software to manage his lab work and conduct experiment. he never takes his work home! 


attack surface - only way to reach his work data is through his lab computer

adversaries - other labs working on the same use case, jealous co-workers, angry anti-GMO crowd!, terrorists, nation state

attack vectors - phishing, zeroday attack, intrl me type hardware vulnurability, 

mitigation - use 2fa, restric network of work machines, encrypt all the data, make back ups, usefall back system that need two other humans cooperation!

hey Eric,


Welcome to HMS! hope you are settling in fine. My name is samar and I am the cyber security expert here. cyber security might seem a little pedantic and maybem out right frustating at times but it's my duty to inform you it's essential for the existence of the institution we serve! 


As you might already know, Genetics is coming into main stream and words like CRISPR are in daily news cycle  with recent popularity we have gained some unwantented attention as well specifically from GMO opposing activists in past months, many of the scientiest at our lab have recieved angry emails and threats from these groups!


Our computing infrastructure is the backbone of our operations, from getting supplies to getting results of DNA sequencing are all dependent on our computing infrastructure. As a precaution, we have created guidlines to curb any future attacks

1. you are not supposed to take your work home! all work remain just on our local network! always!

2. while logging into your lab computer - you are strongly advised to setup 2 factor authentication

3. we have already encrypted data on your machine!

4. especially be careful about phishing - orignal looking - FAKE web pages that steal your data! you should always look at the URL, if it is https. 


lastly, when in doubt contact me! I am happy to help!
