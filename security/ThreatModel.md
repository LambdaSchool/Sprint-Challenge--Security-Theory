Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)


to whom it may concern: 

    This is the assesment for counteracting an attack on the company and its resources. The attack surface situation exposes systems you use and places you go.

    Your adversaries are interested in compromising your security.

    The attack vectors are vulnerable through your passwords and looking to exploit your surveillance systems.

    What we can do for the Mitigations to reduce the risk is implement 2 factor authentication and encryption.
