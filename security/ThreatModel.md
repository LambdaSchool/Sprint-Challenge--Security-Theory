Jianna is your average accountant responsible for managing the finanncial affairs of a non-profit organizations. She keeps track of how much they spend/ recieve, and who the money goes to, and who they recieve it from. The company is somewhat large and she works by herself in her own office. But the company resides in a big/ popular city, and the company is well known in the area. She is loved and cared for in the company, no one really has a problem with each other, they all get a long well, which helps contribute to the great success of they organization.

Jianna does all of her work on her computer; using her email a lot, and communiucating by phone, via call/ text to a lot of clients or business partners. Given the nature of her work, Jianna has to constantly send update reports to her seniors. They use FTP software to send these reports, because not everyone is at their office at all times; sometimes some workers work at home.

Adversaries - A company in a big city = a lot of opportunity for a young hacker to get a "come-up". A rival company can be a adversary. Non pf her companions want to compromise her work, because it in turn, compromises theirs. A successful company will have many in a big city wanting to try to breach their securities.

Attack surface - Given Jianna's circumstance, her email is at risk, her laptop could be stolen with precious information, and her office computer. Her phone, and laptop would b her biggest weakness. The FTP system the company has in place could be attacked as well if their network isn't properly secured.

Attack vectors - If someone gets Jianna's password for her email, they can maybe gain certain security information pertaining to the FTP or where the company sends their money. That can lead hackers to re-divert the routing of the money. If Jianna's phone is stolen that could give the thief a list of the organzations client's/ partners also putting them at risk. If a FTP route isn't secure enough, it could give a hacker crucial finnancial details.

Risks (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, etc) - Everything. The confidentiality of the organizations finnances. The integrity of the finnances, maybe someone could change figures so that it can become hard to track if someone re-routed some money to their accounts, and changed the reports to indiciate a lesser gain to avoid suspicion. And maybe if someones goal is just to sabotage, they can gain certain security protocols to interupt FTP transfers from other workers, that could disrupt the flow at the work-place.

Types of Attacks (Man-in-the-middle, (Distributed) denial of service, Backdoors/malware, social, etc.) - A lot of man-in-themiddle, backdoors/ malware, and brute force hacking (protentially) to try to gain access to Jianna's software. And potentially re-route funds to someone in else to route somewhere else.
