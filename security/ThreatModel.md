The Technology Field Officer of an international bank services ATM machines that are malfunctioning or otherwise need to be manually serviced. The role often includes resetting machines or replacing parts. The attack surface of the officer is larger than an entry-level teller or customer service representative at the bank, but smaller than those with administrative or root access to client financial data. Because of this, less security emphasis may be placed on this mid-level technology role, because these officers only usually perform basic software maintenance on an irregular basis. 

Common adversaries looking to exploit this role would probably be an organized group with technological awareness of how ATM machines are built and process transactions. With the advent of pin-chip technology, simple scanning of card numbers is not as lucrative as it used to be. Instead, adversaries are installing malware to "gush" out cash. The attack surface is rather large, because one service person can visit many machines, while the malware may be executed asynchronously to increase damage. Furthermore, the officer may be susceptible to bribery or potential payout if an adversary threatens them personally. 

Attack vectors from adversaries could include: injecting malware when machines need to connected to a computer to assess an errors, obtaining the officer's credentials to access machines remotely, or impersonating the officer. 

To reduce the risk of this role, the bank should require all operations performed on ATM machines to require a security code for work to be performed on the machine. To access this code, the technician can use a code generator app that is synchronized with the bank itself. Once a code is generated, both the ATM servicing company and the bank are notified of the code generated for the ID of the ATM machine. To prevent malware from being injected via a direct connection, all the computers used should be air-gapped (never connected to the Internet), and require a key fob or similar personal id to access.
