Hi John,

I would like to bring something very pertinent to your attention, which although it may be uncomfortable to think about, it is extremely important to take care of. I have noticed that you have been writing the passwords to our server and databases on sticky notes and leaving them on your desk. While I certainly understand the frustration of forgetting a password and having to search for it, writing the passwords on sticky notes and leaving them in plain sight is really not a good idea. Being that we are number 1 in our industry, our competitors are always looking for ways to learn from our businness model. If the passwords are left out in the open, someone can easily snap a photo of them and snd that to our competitors. To mitigate this problematic situation, I suggest removing all sticky notes, and using a reliable password manager to keep track of the companies passwords, and use a long passphrase to protect the password manager. Additionally, since our security is somewhat compromised already, I will set up 2-factor authorization for our server and database access.
