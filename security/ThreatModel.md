# Security risk associated with using public computer and mobile phones for online banking

With the advent of online banking, more and more people prefer banking online than traditinal brick and mortar banking. Reason being people spend less time and focus more on things they love enjoy than doing boring money transfer or check deposit. However, people don't really give much attention to from where and how they access online banks. Public computers and mobile devices pose considerable security risk. Public devices are used by multiple people and if user does not log out properly, any one can access online account. Even when user logs out, cookies will remain on public computer and anyone who has access to cookies can gather sensitive information and misuse it. Mobile OS might not allow programmer to encrypt data the way Desktop OS does. This will cause app user to send plain text banking data over the network. It is hightly recommended to not use public wi-fi on mobile phones especially for banking. Only use home wifi network / reliable wifi network for sending sensitive information over the network.
