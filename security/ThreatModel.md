Scenario: Coworker that is clueless about the internet

Attack surface: all the websites they use probably
Adversaries: People that want to steal passwords and info of clueless people
Attack vectors: password theft/cracking, tricking them into downloading viruses or clicking on phishing links
Mitigations: To reduce this risk use 2-factor authentification, use a password manager to allow the use of passwords that are varied instead of the same or similar ones across websites. Don't click on suspicious links, and make sure not to download suspicious exe or bin files. Scroll over links before clicking to see where they actually lead to. Disable javascript by default so going to a new possibly compromised website doesn't automatically expose you. Download uBlock origins and start blocking a bunch of stuff. Encrypt valuable files, and keep important information in the physical plane only. Don't trust the cloud and don't connect all your stuff to facebook and google. Make sure your phone is secure too if you're using your email and other accounts on it.

^ (This is the style of what I would write but if I actually cared I would just talk to the coworker and say something along these lines and help them set stuff up if they needed it)
