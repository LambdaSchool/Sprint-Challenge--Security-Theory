# Threat Level Midnight
Mr Smith,  
  
We need to discuse some potintial issues with field sales team. As you know, their laptops have access to a ton of sensitive information including emails and applicatinos with saved passwords.  If one of these laptops were to be stolen, the financal impact could be rather large.  
To limit our exposiure, we need to consider inforcing some security standards.  I think it would be wise to require computer loggins to change once a quarter. We should have strickter password requirements. We should require application passwords be saved inside a secure password manager.  We should restrice access to some of our more sensitive data so that it can only be accessed from within our network.  We should also provide training to all employees on recognizing phishing emails.  
  
Thanks,  
  
Worf  
Chief Tactical Officer
