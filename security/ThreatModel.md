I used to actually look forward to sprint challenges.
They used to be... challenges.
Now they're all essay questions and worksheets.

Threat model:

Me.  I use a password manager, which remains logged in on my laptop,
which has drive encryption and locks after 15 minutes of inactivity.
My phone locks after 1 minute, has drive encryption and pin /
fingerprint authentication.  It is not logged into my password
manager or most of my accounts.  I have 2 factor auth for many
of the services which offer it.

Attack surface:

I only use my laptop in my apartment.  I occasionally go out in
public with my phone.

Adversaries:

Any criminal or scammer who may want to steal my information to abuse or sell it.

I also have a former friend turned bitter enemy who would love to hurt me any way
he can, but he's about as tech savvy as a dead moose, so he poses no threat.
At least not in this context.
pretty much just
Attack vectors:

My password manager is cloud based, so the service itself could be compromised.

An attacker could steal my laptop during the 15 minute period before it locks
itself while unattended, or steal it from me directly while I'm using it.
I've also read that very advanced attackers can potentially get the contents
of the computer memory with physical access to the hardware, so if the laptop
were stolen while on but locked that could still be a threat.

I like to think I'm savvy enough not to fall for phishing or social engineering.

Mitigations:

I feel like I already do a fair bit for security.  There are some services which
offer 2 factor authentication that I haven't set it up on, but honestly the
inconvenience when logging in is a factor here.  I already feel pretty secure
from having unique, pseudorandom passwords for every service thanks to my
password manager.  I have considered switching from the cloud based one
I'm using now to KeePass; I would feel even more secure with an open
source application running on my own machine. Convenience is once again
a factor here: the cloud manager I'm using now has a chrome extension which
autofills things very nicely.  KeePass may or may not have the same functionality.
I will research it.
