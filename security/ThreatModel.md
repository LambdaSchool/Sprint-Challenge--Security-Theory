Office Threat Model

In an office, where each worker is assigned a cubicle in a room filled with rows of cubicle, a worker is susceptible to security risks. A worker can leave his cubicle with his computer unattened to say visit the restroom, take a phone call outside and thus anyone can access his/her computer and get the information they want or plant a bug on it thus affecting the entire office's system.

This situation can be avoided by ensuring all employees know to lock up their computers before leaving their cubicles and to also ensure thar authentication is implemented and passwords are changed periodically.
