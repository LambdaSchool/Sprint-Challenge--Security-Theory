We need to talk about Pam's security!

Her computer has access to all our internal systems, and she needs to retain access to all of them. She takes her laptop with her everywhere (but I've seen her leave it unattended frequently), and her desktop has the login password on a sticky note on the monitor! We've got to have a chat with her about password strength and set her up with a passphrase she can remember. Maybe some kind of positive affirmation, I bet she'll like that.

She's the head of the branch, and for whatever reason she insists that be public on our website... including all her contact info. And she's not especially good at spotting a scam, so when she gets phishing emails, she's pretty likely to click through. Maybe we can improve spam filtering somehow?

I don't imagine she has a lot of personal stuff worth hacking, but her work computers DO have access to all our company files. Stuff our competitors would be interested in. Stuff that any hacker could exploit if they wanted to make a quick buck or just ruin someone's day. So let's get on top of this, shall we?
