Good day Mr. Loo,

Prevention is the first step for every major corporation to reduce risk of security breaches. And security is a prevalent topic as more data leaks and hacks occur through a number of means and we need to do everything possible to limit the exposure we have. We need to ensure that our systems have proper protocols and employee security measures to prevent breaches that happened similarly to Blue Cross Anthem, Equifax, JP Morgan Chase and so on.

As a target of malware, phishing, password attacks, ransomware, denial of service and other threats the need for a two factor authentication for your system will reduce the risk of such security breaches. Implementing the two factor authentication will not only mitigate exposure but enable your employees to secure your company's valuable data.
I look forward to discussing further details with you.

Best,

Amanda
