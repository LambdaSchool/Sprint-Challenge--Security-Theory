Threat Model: 
    Liliana is a gifted young lady who has a musical mind. She's spent the past few years composing new songs. She hopes to one day have her music featured on a major motion picture soundtrack. She uses social media to connect and reach out to other artists and contacts to try and get her music in the hands of the right people.
    As a product of the modern age she rarely uses pen and paper and conducts all of her business electronically through various banking and money management applications. She has full confidence in the applications she uses and doesn't consider how or if they might be compromised. She believes 2-factor authentication is annoying and too much of a hassle so she refuses to use any 2-factor authentication options for her various applications. She believes that logging in everytime she needs to access the application is secure enough since she never stays logged in, and is diligent about logging out when done. Her phone is her primary connection to the outside world her laptop is primarily used to compose and create her music scores. Since she doesn't stay logged in to anything she hasn't bother to setup security measures on her laptop.
    She uses her favorite music creation application; she has found a free version on the internet; but it's a few updates behind the most current pay-to-use version of the same software. While she doesn't pay for the application she does have to purchase music for inspiration; and the simplest way is to utilize the music creation applications store where she can find like-minded peoples ideas and music; and if she ever wants to monetize her compositions she needs to be sure she is completely legal in regards to the music she is reading/listening to for inspiration. If she sees something that she wants to purchase she doesn't want to be bothered with locating her credit card and has setup quick pay and stored her financial information on the applications store section.

Threat Assessment:
    Attack Surface:
    While Liliana doesn't go out of her way to expose herself to threats to her personal information. Due to the nature of the modern age personal information is a gold mine of opportunity; Her use of social media, banking applications, and money management applications can all be used against her to obtain her personal information. Her biggest exploit however is the use of a "free" version of her music creation software. Since it is not the paid version it doesn't feature the various security updates that the software creators employ to insure that their product is keeping their users safe who will in return continue to pay for the product.
    Finally her use of the music store to save her financial information is problematic; as the store is accessed through unlicensed software, it's hard to say how secure her information is.
        Social Media
        Banking Applications
        Money Management Applications
        Unlicensed Software
        Music Application Store

    Adversaries:
        The most obvious adversary is anyone who would benefit from having someones personal information.
        If a person has talent verifiable success they are a target of someone who wants their success for their own. Anyone looking to steal Lilianas music for their own personal gain.
        Anyone who wants to see Liliana fail in order to promote their success. 

    Attack Vectors:
        Phishing is a prolific problem for social media. It could also be used to obtain Liliana's login credentials for her various applications.
        Unlicensed Software can be compromised without the users knowing and without updates new threats cannot be mitigated. The software can be cracked exposing all of Lilianas music, purchases, and financial information.
        While not a direct attack her information can be compromised if the money management application attacked and the attackers are successful at uncovering sensitive personal information.
        
    Mitigations:
        One of the best ways Liliana can protect herself is to just use the paid version of her music application. It will help secure her music/financial information and having the music application developers actively looking for and correcting software exploits.
        She could also setup 2 factor authentication where available to insure that if her login information does get compromised she will be able to sign in and fix the problem before the attackers.
        She would need to double check URLs before providing her login credential to help prevent phishing attacks.
        She could potential utilize additional security measures outside of manually logging in whenever she needs access to her applications. A simple lock on her laptop can help protect the information she has stored on her laptop as well as access to her applications if she does forget to log out.
