Dear Reciever,

Keeping software up to date with security patches is one of the security basics, but WannaCry not only highlighted the well-known fact that security patching is often poorly done in many organisations, it also showed that for some organisations, especially where legacy or critical IT systems are involved, patching can be extremely challenging.

Microsoft released a security update some time before the exploit was leaked.
and a few million Windows systems still had yet to be updated therefore still vulnerable to the attack. so i suggest to always keep your system up to date to mitigate hackers as much as possible.
