Hi XYZ, 

    This is a reply to your previous request of evaluating your security preferences and situations. 

        "I am an entrepeuneur and I handle all my business through phone. I have all my social accounts logged in. However I have a pattern lock on my phone. I also use a laptop from home to handle business meetings and a printer that I print from. I use public wifi most of the times, as I am not in a financially stable place to get private internet. The product I deal in has a niche market but there are still 2-3 competitors that I am dealing with."

    Your quoted message here provides me a lot of information that I already see problems with. Lets look at your attack surface for a possible attack. You use your phone and your laptop and to access internet you use public wifi. Your adversaries could be your competitors or general hacker looking to make a quick buck. The places you could suffer from an attack are your phone, which could be accessed into through social engineering or by just peeking over your shoulder, and since you have everything logged in, you could lose important information. 

    For mitigation you can firstly have a more secure phone that maybe includes fingerprint sensor or facial recognition. Secondly you need reduce your dependance on public wifi, it can result in people taking advantage of information that you might be sending to someone else. Thirdly, I would highly suggest having some sort of antivirus to prevent from malware and viruses from taking over your pc. 

    Thank You
