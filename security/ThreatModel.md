Re:     Security Assessment

Dear Anita,

After taking a look at your work environment - current security measures, technology used, etc, I've come to the conclusion we need to take some additional measures to make sure your risk of attack stays low. 

As an independent educational contractor, it is important that you take measures to ensure not only your information is secure, but that of your students as well. 

As a smartphone user that conducts her business primarily on her phone, be sure to keep your phone locked when not in use. Back up your phone's contents so you don't lose anything in the case of loss - with your smartphone you have the ability to wipe the contents clean if your phone is lost or stolen, either while you're in a gig or out and about. Be certain that you are aware of how to do that in case that happens. 

Invest in a password managing system for both mobile and desktop use. I recommend LastPass - the premium version is very afforable and will give you the ability to access your vault via mobile app and desktop app. This application will generate random passwords for you.

Select a long __passphrase__ as your master password for this application. Passphrase is different from password in that it is a multi-word phrase that you can remember easily that would be hard for a computer to crack. It's much easier to remember a passphrase than it is to remember some random password! My only recommendation here is that it not be a famous quote, title or saying. 

For example, "After all, tomorrow is another day," is a famous quote. Instead use "Scarlett Melly Ashley Vivien Olivia" instead. "Horse Music Books Hiking Computers" could be another. These are just examples - come up with your own that will be easy for you to remember!

After your password account manager is set up, import ALL of your accounts into LastPass and do a security risk assessment (it's pretty easy to do and can be accessed as an option from the main page). Do what the assessment recommends to keep ALL of your accounts more secure!

Your invoicing is currently done using Google Drive and email. If you would like to make it a little more secure, I would recommend PayPal (or something similar) to invoice so the security of account information (names, addresses and the like) is not all your responsibility. 

As a flute teacher, your adversaries are few, but if you take these steps for security, it will ensure both personally and professionally you are well-guarded. 

Thanks for your time,

Christina Kopecky
