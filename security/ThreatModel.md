## Game Software Developer Threat Model

Game leaks are very common in the industry as people wait for the release of a completely brand new game or the sequel to a big hit. Nowadays, the game industry taps into this excitement in the market through pre-orders. However, it's only natural that certain people would be apprehensive about dishing a full brand new game's price out of their pocket ahead of time with no guarantee that the game will be any good or that they'll like it. With many bombs like No Man's Sky, Mass Effect Andromeda (which I still enjoyed) and others, there's a certain appeal to leaks that may give us a glimpse - albeit brief - into our potential investment.

### Everything is stored digitally

From planning, to development, to testing, Q&A's patches and hotfixes, everything is stored digitally for the video games, in some shape or form. As we all know, computers, hard drives and press released copies all become vulnerable as soon as they exist. A developer may go to a public location to use wi-fi to send a quick write-up or mock demo to a co-worker or supervisor. Shared home computers with children or other technologically naive individuals may expose any of their work.

### Hackers, Pranksters, Rivals and the Press

Hackers are notorious for their roles in video games. Shutting down massive online networks, game servers, releasing scripts, gameplay videos or even concept art. These leaks can prove devastating to a game's future, although many of these 'leaks' could be argued as subversive marketing tactics. Pranksters as well, may per their own amusement attempt to access confidential information.

Rival game companies may seek the opportunity to one up their competitors by figuring out the kind of game their releasing, how much man power/budget is being funnelled into project, etc in an attempt to outdo them by beating them to market. As we all know, many youtubers and game critics receive copies days, weeks or certain alpha or beta copies even months before release. Without going into their own attack surfaces, their security is probably a lot weaker than a company's and and certain hackers could access their computer or online presence and release the data publicly.

### Hacks, Cracks, Maybe even Backpacks or camera attacks?

Password theft/cracking software is readily available in the seedier parts of the internet for anyone brazen enough to find and implement it. Jilted employees may release sensitive information to certain groups in an attempt to harm the company without identifying themselves (less likely).

### Divison of Labor, Proper Authorization, and Security Planning

Breaking up different roles based on skills and experience to work on the various parts of the product/brand is not only efficient for labor, but for security as well. By doing so if someone is attacked and succesffuly subverted they may not have all of the information and the damage of the hack could be minimized. This also allows a company or investigators to have a easier time identifying any inside leaks based on the content of the leak and the suspected time of it.

Using very particular record keeping, loose ends could be kept at a minimum as everyone knows who is working on what, when and where. Certain rules will apply to each of these avenues disallowing employees to work at home, in public or discuss their role and work to outsiders. They will be provided work machine and tools that utilize good encryption and 2 factor authentication.
