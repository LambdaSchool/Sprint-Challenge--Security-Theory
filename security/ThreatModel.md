# Threat Model
## Model 1 - Bob (Personal Online Vendor) uses sites such as Etsy and Ebay

Hey, Bob!
I've gone ahead and assesed your situation and produced a threat model for you to review.

#### Attack Surface
Password Cracking/Phishing is the number 1 attack vector your are vunerable to right now. Based on the info you've given, you are using the same passwords for multiple vendor accounts. As well as keeping your passwords saved onto a word file on your personal laptop.

#### Adversaries
Scammers are your top priority when it comes to not only your security, but the security of your customers as well. Once they've gained access to one account they can also gain access to many of your other accounts. Not only gaining your valuable info, but the info of your customers as well. Successfull scammers will then accept orders from your customers and pocket the money.

#### Attack Vectors
One possible attack vector would be your laptop being stolen. If they grab it in an unlocked state, they automatically have gained access to all your passwords if they find your word document. Password phishing/email phising is another. If you accidently leaked one password then your others will become compormised as well.

#### Mitigations
Set up a Password Manager and generate a secure long password for each different vendor account you possess. Now delete that word file containing your old passwords, the password manager will keep track of all that for you. Try as well to lie or think of fake answers to your password security questions. This will prevent your from being a product of social engineering. But even so if that does happen, only one of your accounts will be compromised instead of every single one as before.
