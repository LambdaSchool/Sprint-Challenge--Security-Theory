Hello, Mate,

I wrote descriptions of threat models as belows for your understaning. Wish it helps.

**Attack Surface**
-  Attack surfaces means the sum of the different points where an attacker can try to enter data to or extract data. It can be your laptop, your cellphone, or a printed out design file. Once it is exploited, the attacker can get data of you he/she wants to know.

**Adversaries**
- Adversary means an attacker who wants your dara. Most likely adversaries are our market competitors. They will do whatever they can if they can get the new product informations you've been designing.

**Attack Vectors**
- To reach your laptop or cell phone, attackers may use email links to infest your laptop or cell phone with mallware. To get your design file, they may try to steal it from your car or home.

**Mitigations**
- Do not click an email or text message link which is sent from whom you do not know, or redirects you to unknown url. Never download attached files from suspicious email. Never bring your design file outside of your office.
