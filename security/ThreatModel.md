Oof. I thought you all were going to give us an example. It's going to take me awhile to think of one by myself.

I can't think of anything else so I'm going to use someone I know who is a doctor at a university hospital.
He has a Macbook owned by the university which allows him to access everything from home, including EPIC, the hospital EHR system.
They gave him a physical security key for two-factor authentication.
He either walks or rides his bike to a transit station and then takes public transportation the rest of the way to the hospital. Then he comes home the way he came.

My opinion is that one of his biggest threats is losing or getting his laptop stolen on his way to/from work. The two factor key is decent security - about as good as you're going to get a doctor to cooperate with - but he carries it in the same bag so if someone just rips his bag off, they could potentially access all the medical records in the hospital. I recommend that he remain alert during his commute, don't wear earbuds, don't be staring at his phone the whole time, etc. to minimize the risk of theft. He is a taller than average person and does not look like an easy target for thieves, which helps, but anyone can get clocked over the head. Also, the laptop does have a regular password that the thief would have to get by in order to access the hospital records, so I recommend he make that password as strong as possible, and consider encrypting the whole drive so that it will be even more difficult for anyone to access any information on the computer.
Perhaps he could also carry his security key in a pocket or somewhere separate from the bag containing his laptop so that a thief cannot get everything all at once. Also, he should just wear street clothes and leave everything that could identify him as a doctor in his hospital locker (lab coat, scrubs, stethoscope, etc.). People think doctors have money (fellows get paid crap, but most people don't know that) and therefore he would appear to be a more attractive target for thieves.
I think it is much more likely that someone will just want to steal his nice shiny thin laptop rather than the medical records it can access, but you never know, and it can't hurt to be extra careful considering that people's very personal medical information is accessible through the laptop. Lawyers, insurance companies, even employers might find this information very useful.

In terms of threats online, his two factor key is very helpful, though of course nothing is 100% foolproof. He should always be careful to use password secured wifi and/or a vpn and not just the free one at the coffee shop. If someone can hack into the transmission and steal medical records, they could use them against the individuals or hold the records ransom until the hospital pays them an exorbitant sum or something.
At the hospital, many people use the same computers - other doctors, nurses, PA's, health professionals - to pull up patient charts. To protect patient privacy, everyone should log out when they're done each time. This is a real pain in the rear but it is important for both ethical and legal reasons (HIPAA).
