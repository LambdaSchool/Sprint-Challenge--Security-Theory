--> Identifying the Attack Surface is an important step in risk management and helping to lower chances of a threat. For instance, reading through the written code from an attacker's POV and looking at the possible entry/exit points for vulnerabilities helps find out what can be a possible issue. Depending on the product you are working on, you can try and assume potential threats i.e. competitors of similar product line, con-artists, data phishers etc.

--> Then you need to worry about how they may approach attacking/compromising the security you have in place. What access points are available to the public (do any allow for anonymous access), do any updates open up an exploitable access points, are any personnel capable of being an access point due to weak credential security. Scanning any data inputs from public/anonymous access points is crucial to prevent possible threats from submitting scripts that can lead to information leakage or other malicious deeds. Limiting authorizations to only the necessary level limits ability of lower level personnel's credentials to cause much damage. Credentials that are hard to brute force and are changed inconsistently can further lower risks levels. Risks dont always need to be eliminated but only maintained to an appropriate level.
