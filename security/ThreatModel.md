# Situation 
A user of Github does their due diligence in hosting projects on Github. They only use their password for Github and no where else. And whenever they need to push or pull commits they type in the password everytime. They thought they were doing enough to stay secure.
# Attack Surface
The user uses the same computer everyday, goes to work at the same place everyday and see's the same people everyday.
# Adversaries
Criminals hired or not hired to steal company information. Criminals wanting to compromise security. Pranksters wanting to see if they can hack the user. 
# Attack Vectors
Though the user did good with not repeating passwords, it's still not enough protection against password theft with keylogging.
# Mitigation
The user should consider using a password manager whether it be digital or not. And instead of typing the password everytime the user is pushing/pulling commits is to make an SSH key. Not only will this be more secure it will be faster.
# Letter
Dear User,
I noticed that you are doing your due diligence in keeping up with good security messures. I've noticed during our time working together that you are typing your password everytime you push/pull commits. Now that is not the most secure and effiecent way to do so. I would like to suggest a solution that will help you out with both effiecency and security. 

I would suggest making a SSH key with Github. That way you don't have to type your password in everytime. And I would like to suggest a password manager for keeping your password safe.

Sincerely,
Your CoWorker
