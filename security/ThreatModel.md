It has come to my attention that one of our fellow employee's may be at risk of a security breach. He is a young male who is immersed in several online communities and is an active video game streamer. I have known him for quite some time so know that this information is true and not mere speculation.

The primary access points to which a malicious party could compromise his data would be the following:
- Online profiles
- His video stream
- Multiplayer video games
- Online community

This individual has a gaming community that follows much of what he does and has been growing steadily in the previous months. He seems to trust them, however a mischievous party could try to exploit the above by the following:
- Use information that he shares/displays to try to hack his accounts
- Gleaning personal information from the background of his online stream
- Create a malcious software that connects to victims through video game connection
- Community using trust agains him to glean sensitive personal information
