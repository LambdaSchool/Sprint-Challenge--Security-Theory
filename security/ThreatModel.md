# Threat Model

Hey Mark,

Thanks for reaching out about improving our security here at (E)corp. I've create a simple threat model so we can
better understand the ways we could be attacked and things we can do to mitigate those problems.

#### Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go):

- All employees currently have access to client personal files with include name, address, payment info, and relevant contacts.
- Our network can be accessed without security credentials from employee personal computers or ICD(internet connected devices)

#### Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)

- Thieves, scammers, and other bad actors maybe interested in stealing valuable personal information about our clients
- B Corp and BnL Corp may want to access our network for sabotage or to gain access to our product and service information. They may also be interested in our client information.

#### Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)

- May pose as an employee to gain physical access to a company computer or use employee login info to gain access to our network.

- May insert malware or other types of malicious software on our servers to gain access or destroy important data.

#### Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

- Restrict access to employees to customer/client data

- Have onsite security

- Restrict access to network to onsite only

- Update and patch server on a continues bases.
