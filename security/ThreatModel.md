Cheryl works at a Payroll Service, which deals with lots of personal information (social security numbers, addresses, bank account information, etc.). She works from home on her own personal computer with her own passsword protected WiFi network. She uses Payroll software on her desktop, which holds all of the aforementioned confidential information.  She also has an excel spreadsheet with the usernames and passwords for all of her accounts (payroll software, email, netflix, online banking, etc.) which is protected by a basic password, her favorite baseball team and her year of birth: RedSox63. She uses the same username and password for her email and payroll software. She also texted her son the password for her excel spreadsheet so he could find the log in info for Netflix.
