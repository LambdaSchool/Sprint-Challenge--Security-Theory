Dear Secretary Clinton:

My name is Anthony Calderaro, and I am the White House Deputy Director of Information Technology & Security. It is my responsibility to bring you up to speed with cybersecurity best practices in case you decide to run for President again in 2020. 

This email contains a 3-part breakdown summarizing key information related to cybersecurity. Part 1 will highlight vulnerabilities that exist within the daily routines you perform, Part 2 discusses the adversaries who will try to acquire sensitive information as well as the methods they'll use to bypass our security, and Part 3 offers recommendations for you to implement so that you don't get hacked by the Russians - again.  

Part I: Vulnerabilities
The opportunities for potential adversaries to bypass our security measures are referred to as attack surfaces. There are 3 key attack surfaces I would like to highlight for your: Hardware, Software, and Networks. 

Hardware includes all physical electronic devices such as your phone, laptop, desktop, and even extends to your access card keys for getting in and out of government buildings. It is important that you ensure that you do not allow individuals with unauthorized permission to access or handle your hardware so that you minimze the opportunities for them to steal, copy, or alter important information. 

Software includes programs and applications that come pre-packaged with your work laptop (such as Microsoft Office) as well as web applications you use regularly such as email and social media. 

Networks include any other devices you connect or interact with. We have firewalls in place to prevent bad-actors from interacting with you on your devices, but it is important to take care when connecting to unsecure devices such as public internet, or using bluetooth with devices that you are unfamiliar with. 

Part II: Adversaries
The primary adversaries are criminals and political opponents, which desire access to sensitive information to usurp your political endeavors, slander your image, or leverage to extort and control you. There is immense financial gain to be had if you are compromised, so it is in your best interest to remain skeptical and cautious with your information and devices. They will attempt to attack through a variety of vectors such as hacking or guessing your password, installing malicious software through other applications or hardware you interact with, impersonating you when dealing with colleagues and coworkers, or by stealing the physical devices you work with. 

Part III: Recommendations
While cybersecurity risks are impossible to avoid, there are ways to mitigate the risk exposure to a reasonable amount. Implementing 2-factor authentication on your mobile and desktop devices can help prevent unauthorized access. Setting up secure servers and encrypted messaging for your electronic communication can prevent information from being intercepted. You can also take care to avoid unsecured network connections, unusual websites, and to utilize ad-blockers. It's vital that you do not connect foreign hardware devices to your work networks, and that you receive confirmation before downloading or installing new applications. Furthermore, you can minimize your exposure to password hacks by creating a unique passphrase that is easy to remember but difficult to guess, and changing it regularly. 

This is only a brief highlight of the key cybersecurity issues you'll face in your political career. Should you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to me and I'd be happy to help.

-Anthony
