1.  Software Developers are a prime target for malicious actors, 
they could attempt to spread malware via your users by compromising 
your security. Some ways this could be done are insecure wifi 
networks and password carelessness or reuse.

    One of the best ways to solve the insecure wifi potential is to use a
VPN to connect to a home network which encrypts all data you transfer,
there are many free versions you can run on a computer at home or many
cost effective choices with a quick search.

    Addressing the password issue I would suggest a password manager such 
as lastpass or 1password. Password managers can remember your passwords
for multiple sites or notes you need to keep. They can also generate 
secure passwords for you so you're not tempted to reuse any. Your passwords 
are protected with military level encryption to ensure they are perfectly
secure from any person with ill intentions.

2.  Checked my password manager and updated many passwords that were older or
had any possible reuse. 

Changed password manager password to passphrase.
