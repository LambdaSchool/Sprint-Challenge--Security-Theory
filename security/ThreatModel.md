Dear Mr. Samuelson,

I am sorry to hear that you were recently a victim of phishing when opening an email that contained malicious links and malware. Since you are the CEO of a major film company it is important to be properly secure and have an understanding of the threats and what can be done to prevent such things in the future.

The first thing to consider is the attack surface or technology that may expose you. Although you do use a standard antivirus software that is not enough for these phising attacks that can use context-based social engineering. Instead of using your main company email for all of your correspondence it would be better to have a personal email seperately that you only use on your computer at home.

Adversarires that may be interested in compromising you range from criminals that want to hold your computer and its data and/or movies hostage, or past producers, agents, or actors that have worked with you in the past and feel slighted for some reason.

The attack vectors could range from key-logging your passwords, social-engineering to put ransomware on your computer or locking your computer files so you cannot get access.

Things you should do to mitigate the situation is to not let any important data be on the computer with which you access your emails, be mindful of emails from sources you don't know and haven't vetted, and always be up to date with the latest antivirus protection.
