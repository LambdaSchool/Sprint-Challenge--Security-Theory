Hey,

I wanted to follow up with our lunch conversation about whatsapp and the false sense of security users get thinking theyre data and messages are encrypted. To recap:

Attack Surface: Whatsapp users think theyre messages and info are secure because of encryption.
Adversaries: Non-state actors as well as various governments.
Attack Vectors:

1.  Although messages are encrypted while being sent, they are unencrypted on backups(ios and android backups are wide open).
2.  Whatsapp desktop apps messages are easily readable.
3.  Metadata is readily handed over to any government entity.
4.  Data leakage is a geniune fear as Facebook draws more and more data from the users activity to better provide access to marketers. This is one of the primary reasons both founders have left the company.

Mitigations: delete Whatsapp. uninstall the apps of any devices. Install Signal, here is a link: https://signal.org/

If you have any questions hmu.
