#  Security

Dear My Colleague:

Due to the risk and the damage  generated by the hackers,in the word web network to our company, I will state some of points that has to be well explained to every employee in the company. 

Threat model:  is the operation/process  where we have to expect `when` and `where`  the cyber attack is going to happen, and  knowing the defence steps to deal with that, beforehand, is a must. 

since we are a `financial company` that deals mainly with money transactions, we always  need to well secure the wiring  of  money via encryption ,  as well as the passwords used to login to  accounts must be long enough and contain long  phrases with different characters  and not a single word.

Attack surface = attacker entry points(weak points  of the system). All the software and programs used in our company to send money `in` and `out`, during  every transaction ( all of our partners such City bank software, MoneyGram application , WesterUnion application as well ).

Adversaries = attackers to our website via  using internet 24H. 
Attack Vectors = paths or means used by hacker during the hacking inside our softwares such us logins, password change , payments, user auth ... 

Mitigation = the defence tools and means to prevent the hacking including:  the encryption of  passwords , the length of passwords , users Oauth , the sender and the receiver security questions , the IP addresses of the transactions, 2-factor  ...
