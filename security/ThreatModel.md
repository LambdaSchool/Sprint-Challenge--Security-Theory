Dear Samsung CIO,

I'm contacting you to inform you that your IoT devices are vulnerable to attack by various types of hackers with the intent of commandeering the device(s) to cause harm or to spy on owners, ie your customers. These hackers will attempt to penetrate the device(s) by penetrating the local network where the device is attached. I highly recommend that you emphasize to your customers that they implement stringest security measures to preempt these attacks, such as:
- Configuring their local manager to only allow specific MAC addresses
- Setup security monitoring and alert software that will inform when a hacker is attempting to or has breached their local network

Sincerely, 
The Jealous & unSmart Washing Machine

Dear Sony CIO,

I'm contacting you to inform you that your email and personnel systems are vulnerable to attack by the North Koreans and sensitive information can be altered, deleted or stolen. The NK hackers will attempt to penetrate your network through brute force cracking, surveillance and eavesdropping, and phishing. As a seasonsed security expert, I would highly recommend your IT department increase security measures to protect against these coming attacks, such as: 
- requiring passwords that contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Implementing 2 factor authenticantion

Sincerely,
Seth Rogen
