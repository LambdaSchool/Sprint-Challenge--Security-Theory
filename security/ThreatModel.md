Terrence cannot be bothered with all this new fangled technology, but he is slowly learning that in order to run a successful trucking company, that he has to learn to use technologies such as GMail, ComData, etc. He is overjoyed when he learns that while using Google Chrome that he can save any of the login information for the various sites he uses to conduct his business. Thinking it would be easier to remember, he uses the same password for ALL of the various sites he uses in managing his company. He has come to me to help him assess his cybersecurity after being hacked and substantial amount of money has been taken from his ComData account.

I was able to determine that the most likely cause of the hack and theft were caused by him logging into a computer at a truck station and used autocomplete to log into his Comdata site. Unfortunately, he did not log out of his google account, and another trucker was able to use the same autocomplete feature to access many of his accounts. We were able to beef up his cybersecurity by using LastPass password manager to create a complex and secure password for each of the sites he needs to conduct his business. We also created him a new Google account and showed him how to log out after using the account on a computer that is not his own as to prevent someone from accessing his LastPass information. Following our cybersecurity plan, Terrence is confident he won't have any further breaches in the foreseeable future.
