# Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

In modern society, an important part of a person's well-being is to have adequate cyber security in order to protect sensititve information. A common mistake for a user to have is to have the same password for every account they own on different websites like bank and email accounts. If a person with malicious intent were to gain access to these accounts, it would be easy to impersonate the user and compromise their finances, personal relationships, and equally bad - to sell this information to others. 


Understanding the threat of using the same password for every account is only half the battle, the most important thing is to take actions to combat it. A highly recommended solution is to use a password manager, which will store a person's user information and encrypt it allowing only the person with the master password to access it. Another way to combat this risk is to enable two step authentication if an account service provides it. This is a second layer of protection that will occur after a person enters their username and password. One example of the second step of authentication is to be sent a code (that will expire within a certain time) through email or phone that needs to be entered in order to gain access. Using these two methods to secure information is simple and increasingly crucial as attack on personal information become more sophisticated every day.
