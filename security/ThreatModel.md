Preliminary Threat Model Analysis of Senatorial Candidate Mosswell, D-NV

A senatorial candidate is a highly public figure, accessible by nearly any person during certain periods of an electoral campaign. The candidate relies on the information and abilities of dozens or more staff members, and is further dependent on a robust network of software which facilitates communication within the organization. All of these, from the candidate themselves, to the email server used by their cellphone, are potential vectors of attack for spies and hackers. Key points of vulnerability can be identified: the administrators of servers used for communication software are a classic point of weakness in a system, and preventing negligence or malicious activity in this domain can pay massive dividends. A full analysis of your organization will identify and minimize many specific threats of this nature.

In counterpoint to internal knowledge of your system's weaknesses is the equally important awareness of your enemies and their motives. While some external threats can be easily identified by their stated political affiliations, many opponents do not label themselves as eagerly. Proper security requires a constant examination of the individuals at the periphery.

In the defense of your organization against these threats, the greatest tool is education. The information industry has developed excellent tools to use in the interest of security, and our best programmers continue to innovate in the field. The key task is to understand and implement these securite interfaces correctly. Our consultants can not only teach your staff to use 2 factor authentication to prevent themselves from being impersonated by an attacker, they can teach the receptionist to recognize when a friendly visitor is asking inappropriate questions. 

This concludes our outline of your unique security situation. Contact us to dicuss how we can help keep your ship afloat during this stormy election season.
