CEO wants to restructure the network security at our company's Palo Alto office. He feels that when an employee leaves his/her desk, the computer is at risk because anybody can jump in and steal any information.
I want to propose him that we ask employees to log out before they leave, require them to change their personal passwords more often and make sure authentication is done properly.

What do you think my dear co-worker?
