1. My girlfriend uses her personal laptop to manage her professional photography site which holds sensitive images, client information, trasaction information and client contracts. She also uses the same laptop for her job of managing a retial store. She leaves open logged in web pages which allow access to the companies sales reports, strategies, marketing and various sensitive data.

Attack Surface - Leaving multiple sites logged in. Same password across many accounts. Logs in at coffee shops and open wifi venues.

Adversaires - Competing retail stores. People using photos for free without permission. People wanting to gain personal information and sensitive photos of clients. 

Attack Vectors - Personal laptop with no timeout/logout set. Non-encrypted passwords. Shared passwords with multiple employees.

Mitigation - Setting each accounts password. Installing an encrption security. Setting a timed logout on pc. 2-factor auth on all accounts that have access to it.

2. The user has many sites and accounts accessed on a regular basis that have minimal secuirty in place to protect. With the combonation of her personal work and professional there is endless data that can be easily breached that would put her and all parties involved at risk of creative theft and substantial money theft and damages. 

I am recommending a timed logout on her personal laptop used to access these accounts that will logout her PC when idle as she tends to leave it unattended for periods of time do attend to other work. This will prevent anyone from getting onto these accounts physically through her PC and taking information upright or changing passwords and security settings and locking her out of said accounts.

I am also encouraging a full reset on all passwords accross said accounts making them unique thus preventing someone who has breached a passwords to access all accounts as she shares certain passwords for shared access with employees. Also implimenting keepass to secure and encrypt all passwords accross these accounts and enabling two factor auth on all professional accounts. 

Needless to say there are many things that can compromise her personal and professional businesses if accessed. Setting these precautions will help prevent uneeded risk and help secure sensitive data from being accessed and stolen.
