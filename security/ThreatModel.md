Greetings Bob, 

This is an email to inform you about several of our best security practices we have in our company. As you may already know we work with highly classified and sensitive data throughout the day. Therefore, we are valued targets for many adversaries such as cyber criminals, social engineers, organize crime, and competitors. As an employee of this company, you must be aware that an attack may originate from any surface, direction or person. Some of the threats you should research in your spare time include computer malware, ransomware, DDoS, and social engineering. This email will provide you with crucial advice on how to protect yourself and your workstation from these types of attacks. 

While on company grounds you should be aware of tailgaters. Do not let people enter any part of our facility without letting our company’s security systems validate their credentials first. It is in our company’s security policy to have employees scan their ID on badge readers attached to each door at the company. Before your begin work every morning at your workstation you should check all of your USB ports. If you find unknown USB devices connected to your workstation please contact our security personnel right away. These unknown USB devices may contain key logger software to steal data and passwords from your computer. As for passwords to your accounts at the company, make sure they are unique and at least 8 to 12 characters long with a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. As a result, you will better protect your passwords from password cracking software. If you are managing many different accounts at the company you can contact our IT department for password manager software recommendations. Lastly, when you are receiving emails or when you are browsing the web you can use the hypervisor software installed on your workstation to test the links in an email or web page within a virtual environment. If the virtual environment becomes infected with malware as a result of clicking on those links only the virtual environment will be infected and not your host machine. 

If you will like to know more about potential attacks within our company please feel free to contact me or our IT department at any time. 

Best Regards, 
Edward Gonzalez
