# Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a
context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts
you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a
professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file
`ThreatModel.md` with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise
fashion.

The user is my father, who think he's pretty computer savy, but is not (even more dangerous!).  He is exposed to phishing attacks via e-mail and webbrowsing, as well as malware, adware, trojans, worms, spyware, and keyloggers which may be present in any of these.  He is very likely to be enticed by clickbait in e-mail, during browsing, and while reading his daily digest of left-wing blogs.

These adversaries are most likely criminals looking to steal passwords (which would enable access to his banking sites) and personsal data (which would allow criminals to apply for credit cards in his name.  To mitigate, he can ensure that all passwords for critical applications (banking, email) have two factor authentication.  Vigilence is key to avoid threats such as phishing and malware, and adware.
