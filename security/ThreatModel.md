# Threat Model


#### Attack surface:


#### Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)


#### Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)


#### Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)
