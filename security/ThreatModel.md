It has come to my attention that one of our fellow employee's may be at risk of a security breach. He is a young male who is immersed in several online communities and is an active video game streamer. I have known him for quite some time so know that this information is true and not mere speculation.

The primary access points to which a malicious party could compromise his data would be the following:
- Online profiles
- His video stream
- Multiplayer video games
- Online community
