Hello Captain Turanga Leela,

i would like to express my concern over possible security risk on bored your ship.
the on board computer system may be at risk,
this may lead to navagation failures and even greature catastrophes.

A ship carrying many goods could be the target of all types opportunistic criminals, as well as people a board the ship with their own motives, Bender is the greatest risk to the ship.

If you leave the password to the on board express ship system anywhere in the open, on a sticky note for example, or just written down anywhere it can be a major security risk, Bender could sell this password or use it to achieve hes own goals, also the professor has the ship under surveillance, this is a possible massive security risk, crimnals could get the security feed and figure out any thing they need to compromise the express ships on board systems. 

If you would like to reduce risk to attacks i have a few ideas. First do not write down the password anywhere, and create an encypted log in process. Second have the camras removed from the ship it is a massive security issue, if this is not possible then at least make sure the console for logging into the system is never captured. Third do not allow Bender to use or even view you using the system console, and change the password for the system after every trip. 

sincerely
-Hermes Conrad
