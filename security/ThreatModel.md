Greetings Eliot, 

Welcome to the E-Corp family! As an important notice for your first day on the job I will like to introduce you to some of our basic security practices. Throughout your tenure at this company you will be working with highly classified and sensitive data. Therefore, you are a valued target for cyber criminals, social engineers, and our competitors. As an E-Corp employee, you must be mindful that an attack may originate from any surface, direction, or person. Some of these threats include computer malware, ransomware, DDoS, and social engineering. This email will provide you with crucial advice on how to protect yourself and your work computer from these types of attacks. 

While on company grounds you should constantly be aware of tailgaters. Tailgaters pose a serious threat to the safety of our employees, technological infrastructure, and company secrets. As an E-Corp employee, do not let anyone enter any part of our facility without allowing our security systems authenticate their credentials first. All employees must scan their ID badges on readers attached to every door at the company. 

When you are at your desk, you should check the USB ports on your computer regularly to thwart unauthorized USB devices from being connected to your computer. Unknown USB devices may contain key logger software that can potentially steal your passwords by recording every key stroke you make or may contain a malicious program that can execute commands to steal and make the data on your computer inaccessible until a ransom is paid. If you find unknown USB devices connected to your computer please contact our security personnel right away. 

To keep your company account password secure do not write it down or store it in a digital file. This password should not be similar to any passwords related to your personal accounts. It should be at least 8 to 12 characters long with a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Thus, you will better protect your passwords from password cracking software. If you are managing many different accounts at the company you can contact our IT department for password manager software recommendations. 

Lastly, if you notice a suspicious link, source address, or an attachment in an email or web page you can use the hypervisor software installed on your computer to test them within a virtual environment. If the virtual environment becomes infected with computer malware by clicking on a link or an attachment, the virtual environment will be solely infected and not your host machine. Therefore, you can delete the infected virtual environment and reinstall it. 

If you will like to know more about potential attacks within our company please feel free to contact me or our IT department at any time. 

Best Regards, 

Edward Gonzalez
