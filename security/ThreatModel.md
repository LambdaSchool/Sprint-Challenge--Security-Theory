### ATTENTION ###

To whom it may concern,

  After getting important files encrypted by a malicious attack of Ransomware last month we are sending out this notice to bring several security issues to light. First I would Like to point out several things that I've noticed and/or has been brought to our attention that are common security risks. 
  * Do not leave your computer logged in when you are not at your desk.
  * Please do not write your passwords down and leave them at your desk.

  * Change passwords often.
  * Do not open suspicious Email, visit unauthorized websites, download Unauthorized software from your workstation.
  * Log out of all personal Devices when not in use and use 2fa or Authenticator program, and/or keePass.
