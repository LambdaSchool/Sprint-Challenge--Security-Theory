# Threat Model for Mike the auto body shop owner
Mike owns an auto body shop, he has a few employees none of which he did background checks on. He uses a single weak password for everything, there is no password on his office computer. There are multiple competitors within 1 square mile of him. All the competitors are constantly battling for each other's customers. He has a safe but only keeps some of his records in there, most of them are located in an unlocked file cabinet. All of his client's personal information is located in that file cabinet. He has little understanding of the technology he uses, he's old school and was slow to incorporate technology into his business and often resents having to use it. He does have a security system which includes cameras and windows/door sensors.

1. Attack surface: Having one weak password he uses for everything is a large security risk. Obviously if someone gets a hold of it they will have access to everything. Storing most of his information in an basic file cabinet that has no lock is also a disaster waiting to happen. Exposing his customers personal information would kill the trust he has with his customers and drive business to his competitors. Not having a password on his office computer is obviously dangerous. 

2. Adversaries: Identity thieves would drool at his unlocked file cabinet and his unlocked office computer. A few of his competitors are shady individuals who would have no problem using his lack of security in order to bury mike and his business. 

3. Attack vectors: Password theft would be easy and quick considering he uses a single weak password for everything. A thief could break in and steal information from both his office computer and his file cabinet. The thief could even be one of his employees considering he did not do a background check on any of them.

4. Mitigation: Mitigating this situation would be relatively easy. He should use a password manager in order to use safe complicated passwords. Switch his file cabinet for a secure cabinet which he should lock after every use, and keep the key on his person at all times.

5. Summary:

# Part 2
I currently use a password manager with a long password to log into it, I have two factor authentication on most of the sites that offer it. I have been considering getting a Yubikey, after this week I will be ordering one.
