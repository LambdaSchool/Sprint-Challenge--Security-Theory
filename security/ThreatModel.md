For a typical systems admin or IT professional working in the tech industry, the attack surface they are exposed on might include the endpoints on their server, requests that generate a heavy load, weak passwords for server access, and foreign usb devices inserted on work computers. The adversaries faced would vary based on the field that is chosen but a few would be consistent throughout. They might include competitors trying to steal information, extortionists attempting to DDOS the servers if demands are not met, disgruntled customers retaliating for perceived harm, and idle hackers looking to cause damage for fun.

Some of the potential attack vectors for this situation could be password theft and/or cracking via a rainbow table. Another would be spying to physically observe a password being entered or software that records keystrokes to log the password and send it on. DDOS could be a route that attackers might take by spinning up instances of cloud-based servers and populating them with a simple program to repeatedly request files from the server under attack. Another attack method would be injection through an endpoint where code is sent to the server as a string and then executed by the internal server logic. Some ways to mitigate these attacks include using a password manager to safely store and retrieve complex and hard to crack passwords. DDOS can be prevented by having backup servers ready to spin up during periods of heavy load. In addition, endpoints on servers should have logic preventing harmful code from being injected or foreign code from being executed at all.
