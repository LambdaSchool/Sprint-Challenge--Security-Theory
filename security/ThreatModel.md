# Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a
context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. 

    Ramsomware : Everyone use email to comunicate and should be educated in how to be alert and prevent a ransomware attack, since malicious links in email is still one the most common method to deliver ransomware.

Concepts
you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)

      email links
      document attachments like PDF, Microsoft Word, or other common file type. This document contains a script that launches the ransomware.

- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a
professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file
`ThreatModel.md` with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise
fashion.
