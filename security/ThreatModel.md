# Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a
context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts
you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a
professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file
`ThreatModel.md` with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise
fashion.

## Kaitlyn's Summary: 
Threat Model: User of online gaming website 

Context: Received phishing email from hacker posing as legitimate gaming website in effort to obtain user login info in order to obtain access to users account so hacker could transfer in-game currency and equipment. 

Professional Email: 

Hello Comrade - 
It's been brought to my attention that there has been a rash of phishing emails sent out to users of our game and accounts are starting to be compromised. These emails mimic our own internal emails and directs users to a website with a nearly identical URL and design elements to our own site.

Once on the phishing site, Users have been directed to "update" their account credentials, thereby giving away their login information to the hackers. Within minutes of unknowingly giving away this information, the hackers login to the users game account and transfer all in-game equipment and currency which is then sold on a black market. 

To resolve this issue we should immediately enable 2-factor authentication for our user accounts. In the short term, we should send emails to all users warning them of these attacks and reiterate that we will never ask for their private account credentials unless they've requested a PW reset. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Thanks,
Kaitlyn
