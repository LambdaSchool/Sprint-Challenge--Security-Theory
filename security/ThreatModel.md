### Threat Model Example

1. As a software developer it is much more important to protect your computer, online activity, personal information because you will likely be exposed to more frequent and more serious potential threats; and it is your job as a developer to protect yourself and your work in this way. You could say your personal information and your reputation are on the line in a way. Companies will not want to hire you if they cannot trust you to protect yourself and their business. 
The more frequent threats working in this industry happens simply by just being around many more people with hacker capabilities and maybe having potential information any of them might deem to be useful. 
When looking at a threat model you need to consider your Attack Surface, Adversaries, Attack Vectors, and Mitigations. Your attack surfaces include your environments(people can hear you talking or see you and possibly identifying information where ever you are), some of your personal possessions that would help an Adversary gain access to you personal information(bank cards, access cards etc., paperwork etc.), your computer and many of the websites and computer programs you use. For a software developer you need to be aware of your surroundings, and secure your computer and information. The Attack Vector is a hacker/criminals specific route of entry to your personal information. If they are watching your screen or send a virus through your email, or steal and use your credit card. Mitigations you should take to avoid catastrophe include using a password manager, being aware of your surroundings, logging out and shutting off your devices, keeping your devices and other potential Attack surfaces in safe places, be careful trusting people in general with too much information, and be careful what you share online and how you store information. Encrypt and secure things when you can. 
There are people out there who can and will compromise you and your personal information if they can. Just be aware that the threat is real and could be someone closer to you than you think. Then take the necessary precautions to protect yourself.
