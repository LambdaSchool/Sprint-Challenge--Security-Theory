# Threat Level Midday
Mr Smith,  
  
We need to discuss some potential issues with the field sales team. As you know, their laptops have access to a ton of sensitive information including emails and applications with saved passwords.  If one of these laptops were to be stolen, the financial impact could be rather large.  
To limit our exposure, we need to consider enforcing some security standards.  I think it would be wise to require computer logins to change once a quarter. We should have stricter password requirements. We should require application passwords be saved inside a secure password manager.  We should restrict access to some of our more sensitive data so that it can only be accessed from within our network.  We should also provide training to all employees on recognizing phishing emails.  
  
Thanks,  
  
Worf  
Chief Tactical Officer
