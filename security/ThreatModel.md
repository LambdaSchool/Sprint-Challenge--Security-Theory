Dear minions,

In this day and age we can never be too cautious in regards to keeping ourselves safe from digital intrusion in our lives.  Especially as master developers, we are unfortunately targeted by those who would do no good in the world.  That is why it is of the utmost importance that we be aware of potential vulnerabilities in our behavior and do everything in our power to keep our data as secure as possible.

Potential threats are all around us, from 13 year old Timmy trying to swipe credit cards for more Fortnite funds to foreign powerhouses attemping to stir confusion in our lives.  Some attacks may be aimed at stealing identities, tampering with or releasing private data, or infecting infrastructure.  Once compromised the options for containing a situation become limited, therefore the best course of action is to make it as difficult as possible to gain access in the first place.  There are a few simple things that can go a long way in keeping secure:

• Use strong passwords, different for each website.  Use 2FA whenever supported!  Very much encouraged to use a password manager, as brute force attacks are more and more common.

• Keep data secure!  Make backups where appropriate on designated platforms.  Be aware to never post any sensitive data in an external space that could potentially used to gain access to our systems.

• Make sure to keep up to date on all secutiry updates!  If you don't know how to do something speak up and a friendly IT hero will set you up.

These guidelines are just the minimum of what we can do to stay in control of our own data.

Stay safe out there!
