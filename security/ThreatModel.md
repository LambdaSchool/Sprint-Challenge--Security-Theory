Hello Client,

    It has come to our attention that there are a few security issues that are directly affecting your users data. What we have found is that your users passwords can be seen when inspecting the website data in a browser. This is a major cause of concern from a business standpoint as well as a consumer privacy standpoint and should be addressed immediately. Your customers data is highly sensitive and it is imperative that we take swift action to prevent hackers from compromising your product even further.
    
    We suggest implementing password encryption in to your backend so that passwords come through in the inspect page as hashed symbols. There are programs like BCrypt for exactly this that come highly recommended. Should you have further issues, we will be in touch immediately.
