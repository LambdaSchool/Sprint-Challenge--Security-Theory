Part 1. Threat Model

Welcome New Recruits! 

It is with great excitement that I welcome you to our team. I trust that you will enjoy working with us. Trust me when I say that there is never a dull moment here. As all of you are settling in, here are a few suggestions to keep you cyber safe. Safety and security are always our top priorities.

Please be aware that our Adversaries such as cyber criminals and organized crime lords are always trying to hack their way into our system. Last week alone, we have had over 10,000 attempts. Rest assured that they have all been repelled. Although we have the best cyber security infrastructure in the world (thanks to Tony Stark), do not be surprised that Adversaries will try to target one of you. Their common Attack Surface are your email and social media accounts.

Please be cautious in opening any unfamiliar emails. Many of you may be fans of Thor but he doesn't email. He doesn't even use a laptop. So if you see an email from him, NEVER open it and contact our IT department right away. You can get compromised by getting hacked, password theft/cracking, or worse, identity theft. Although they cannot mimick your super powers, they can mimick you online.

Hence, we highly recommend that you help us mitigate them by being vigilant. Always err on the side of caution. For those of you who are still using the same passwords for all accounts, I highly recommend getting a password manager or have a 2-factor authentication. If any of you are interested in more Online Threat Mitigation solutions, please contact our IT Department. 

Thank you and I welcome you!

ps. Training tomorrow will start at 03:00.

Sincerely,
Black Widow
