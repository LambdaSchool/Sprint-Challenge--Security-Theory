If I actually had money, I would have been a hacker's dream come true. I've actually been hacked too!  You would think I would have learned something. While I was at my cancer center getting one of my treatments, I decided to order tires for my car, because winter was coming. Scheduled my appointment, and paid for the tires, all on the comfort of my Kindle... using the cancer center's wi-fi...  Thinking back on that now....

“Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”
Matthew 10:16

Sorry, Lord...

Thankfully, I keep track of my budget (on my previously unprotected computer) and was able to find the hack that stole $400 from my bank account, which was used to purchase gift cards at Lowe's, and reported it to my bank. They launched their own investigation, and I got my money back. Whew! You would think that would have taught me something more than just “don't do financial transactions over public wi-fi.” But... I am an idiot.

I use my computer for hobbies (3d modeling, game design, programming and tutorials), playing video games, paying my bills, and making online purchases. I've never much worried about security, because that's all I do on it. Now, however, I am attending Lambda School to become a software engineer. Now I am downloading all sorts of new programs, including VS Code, node.js, postman, Ubuntu, MongoDB, and who knows how many libraries that are requirements for other libraries to work. In short, my computer has become a stomping ground for the mysterious unknown. I've also been introduced to the world of hackers, and now realize how many different avenues of approach that a hacker can use to gain access to somebody's computer. I always took it for granted that if I was only visiting trusted sites, that I didn't have to worry about being hacked. Now I know that a site may not even be aware that it is being used as an unwitting accomplice for a scumbag black hat hacker. So... Let's do a threat analysis of my current situation, and figure out how to go about correcting some of these issues.
