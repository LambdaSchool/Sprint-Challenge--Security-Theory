### Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

For attack surface on emails, scammers will probably send you junk mails and have a link for you to click on and direct you to a nosecure site or that link might just force you to download virus straight to your computer.

For adverssries within the context of emails I would say it is more of a criminal thing over a prank.  From my experience emails are a lot easier for scammers to contact you and give your computer virus whereas facebook you usally know who is pranking you because there are more data about your friend's profile and I don't really get that many junk mails from facebook compare to my emails..

For Attack vector I would say maybe the scammers might want you to buy their antivirus protections.  There can be a lot of reasons.  Maybe they might want your identity and sell it.  

For mitigations don't open any emails you are not aware of and block them.  Don't ever click on any links in your email if you don't know where that email is coming from.
