# Threat Model

## Scenario

Stephen is a teacher in high school. His classroom is equiped with a macintosh computer, connecting to the internet through wifi, rather than using hardwire. His desk is miles away from the ethernet outlet, so it was decided that it would be beneficial to use wifi that is already available school-wide in strong signals rather than using a very long ethernet cable in a cumbersome manner.

Stephen requires frequent access to his computer to pull up his data for class use or to send files to and receive emails from other staff of the school, so it is often the case that he gravitates toward not using any password or pattern to secure his computer. However it should be noted that his computer is constantly under his supervision. The computer is always in front of him when he's at his desk, except when he is in front of the class to teach, or leaves the classroom during lunch time from time to time.

Stephen's general accounts for emails and filesharing services have same email, same password, and logged in all the time for the convenience of quick access. It seems that he prefers to store files on cloud and use emails to send prepared class materials or quizzes/tests from home (rather than using traditional USB sticks) so that he has a backup of his files as long has he has access to internet.

The school wifi which provides internet access to all staff members of the school is password locked. The students are locked out of internet access to restrict them from using smartphones during class, but some students seems to be able to use the wifi for unknown reason.
