# Part 1 Scenario: Dangers in company security

Hello, everyone. I've been notified of several notable issues regarding security. I'm sending a email to everyone explain how we can mitigate these flaws, so please read carefully. 
Our company specializes in creating new bleeding edge tech products, so getting there first to the market and ensuring no other rival company knows what we're making gives us a huge advantage in the market. If we have company projects leaked, it can lead to another company making a similar product and providing competition. Additionally, we also have a large database of client information. In the scenario that gets illegally accessed, our client base will be at risk for harm. Criminals and corporate espionage spies have a very vested interest in these, so I'd like to take some time to remind everyone of some practices.

I have been notified that several employees have been storing passwords onto physical notes and the like. This is an extremely dangerous risk as anyone can steal your passwords directly. We ask every that does do this to shred (not simply discard) those notes right away. I understand passwords can be tedious to remember for your work, but it's better to be safe than sorry. In the scenario you do forget your password, you need only to submit a ticket to the IT department for your password to be reset. 
Adding onto this, I've been told that there was a security flaw with our company software which involves a bug with how passwords are encrypted. For one reason or another, the password was stored as plain-text in that database while being encrypted but never gets removed. THis issue has been fixed as soon as it was found, so updating is mandatory and everyone's password has been reset. If you are reading this email, you have probably already done this. 

-Regards, IT team
