Situation
- A lawyer that manages multiple sensitive data on clients and cases, which may include bank related information, personal relationships, evidence, media, witness information, statements, confidential documents, etc.

Attack Surface
- Working outside secure premises is bound to happen by leaving the office/working remotely. In these cases the information contained in a personal computer might be exposed to common threats by undesired parties.

Adversaries
This strongly depends on each case scenario, but in a general sense:
- Parties opposing the cases.
- Family from involved parties.
- Third parties not clearly involved in a case.
- Intent to retrieve evidence.
- Strong interest on clients information.
- Criminals: kidnappers, extorsionists, etc.
- Pranksters.

Attack Vectors
- Outside of digital threats, the equipment could also be stolen and physically compromised.
- An unknown USB can be connected and used to leak compromise the data.
- Carefully assessing which websites to visit and to give information too is a must.
- Usage of a weak password easy to brute force.
- Installing untrusted programs/ getting infected by a virus.
- Leaving the computer unsupervised when logged in.
- Using just one password for everything.

Mitigations:
- Carefully managing network connections by using a secure one is essential as credentials and other information could be compromised.
- Avoiding using public networks as much as possible.
- Using Tokens/ Two-Step Auth.
- Using a good anti-malware anti-exploit antivirus.
- Avoiding as much as possible typing a password several times as a keylogger or an onlooker could potentially retrieve it.
- Using different and strong passwords and change them periodically.
- Auto-lock device when not in use.
- Avoid connecting unknown devices.
- Avoid downloading/installing unknown software.
