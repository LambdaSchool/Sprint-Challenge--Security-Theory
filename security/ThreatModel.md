<pre>Dear <i>JMARKian's</i>,

In an effort to further increase <i>JMARK'S</i> cyber security, we'd like talk about our biggest threat to security, phising, and how you can help to fortify our first line of defense.

First off, what is phising?
Phising is a type of fraud in which a hacker attempts to gather personal information by impersonating a legitimate source or by sending users to a malicious web site. Hackers try to obtain any information that could help them pose as someone else, usually to steal money or intellectual property.

Your interaction with phising is most likely going to be via email. It may seem like a legitimate email, but make sure to check all of these things to ensure you aren't being phished: <ul>
<li>Check if the sender's email is suspicous or misleading.</li>
<li>Do not click on links or attachments from suspicious senders.</li>
<li>Be especially wary of unwarranted compressed or executable files.</li>
<li>Never share personal information (usernames/passwords).</li>
</ul>

Thanks again for helping to keep our network safe from cyber threats!

Best Regards,

Shawn Stewart</pre>
