Joe is an investment advisor for one of the nation's largest personal wealth management firms. He is generally good at keeping his computer locked when he's not using it, and keeps other sensitive papers locked in a file cabinet. However, considering the size and success of the firm, there are frequent attempts to gain access to PPI and other sensitive information to steal clients or ruin the firm's reputation.

One of the most likely attack surfaces is Joe's computer; not only is his client data on there - anyone logged into the system can access data of any client that invests in the firm. If Joe was less attentive to his file drawer key, they could possibly steal information from a few clients that he keeps in there. These sorts of offenses could be perpetrated by individuals from competing firms, but recently we have had several of our employees express displeasure that they are not being compensated appropriately for their contribution to the firm's success, and one has even walked out on the job (without notice), and security caught him with a thumb drive packed with client files. 
Since our CRM is hosted on our firm's intranet, it is not likely that we have to worry about someone tapping into our system from outside one of our buildings. However, we do have to be wary of social engineering attempts, especially of those pretenting to be outside contractors (because our firm does have a lot of contractors). As long as all employees keep their workstations locked and passwords maintained appropriately, it is unlikely that we will be breached from that angle. The easiest way for us to mitigate these risks is to continue awareness training and security workshops to maintain good practices. It is most important that employees keep their workstations locked, not share redentials, and know how to identify suspicious behavior.
