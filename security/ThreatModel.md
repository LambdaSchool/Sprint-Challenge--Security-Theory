Re: Security Assessment and Threat Model

Hi Stephen,

Per our conversation earlier, I have analyzed your current security preferences and settings, and used the information you've given me about how you use your work laptop and cell phone to prepare some security recommendations that will reduce the threats of your information and data being compromised. 

Your role in the organization as Chief Growth Officer means that much of your time is spent out of the office at conferences, speaking events, and prospective client meetings, both here and abroad. Although we do have systems in place to make your laptop and cell phone relatively secure, I did want to provide you with some additional steps you can take to protect both your personal and business information on your devices.

For both your mobile device and your laptop, we have assessed how your information/data may be compromised, by who, in what ways, and what you will be able to do as you are away from the office to help mitigate the ability for attackers to compromise your devices. 

Please consider these scenarios in which your device may become susceptible to attack/hacking:
- Text Messaging: Though this is a preferred method of communication for some, sending any sensitive information via SMS may be able to be intercepted if it is exposed to an insecure network/connection. The best mitigation for this is to not send any sensitive data via text, and even preferably not over a voice call, if you can meet with that person face to face to relay the information.

- Leaving your device unattended/unlocked. This is an obvious one, but worth mentioning, as it is always good to remain aware that in another office or a restaurant--especially given your high profile in the industry--leaving your device unattended is an invitation for competitors or nosy clients to ascertain confidential information about you and/or the company. Should you do so and lose your device, please notify IT immediately so that we can remotely wipe your drives. (We also have images of your drives taken once a week, so we can restore most of your data within 24 hours should you recover the device(s)).

- Unencrypted storage of sensitive media. It is likely that you communicate with an receive internal documents about our company that aren't meant to be shared with anyone outside of the office, and the only way to access them sometimes is to download to your phone or laptop in an airport, restaurant, etc. Again, while there are tools in place on your devices (such as our VPN), the documents themselves may not be password protected, thereby allowing anyone who gets into your machine access to sensitive, private company data. To mitigate this, please try to lock any sensitive documents by requiring a password to open them--especially documents that are only meant to be shared internally with other company executives.

- Lost or stolen devices. In the same vein as the above, should your devices get lost or stolen, any unencrypted data that may be on them will be freely accessible to those who have stolen them. For this reason, we will make you change your passwords on both devices every three weeks, and each device will have to have a unique password. Apart from that, consider a password management tool (such as KeePass) to keep a secure record of your passwords. This way, you can keep separate passwords for EVERY account/access point you may have, and not have too much trouble retrieving the login information.

- Border Screenings/Checkpoints. Though this is less critical, the fact that you do travel internationally for our company requires us to alert you to ways in which you can protect the data on your devices from the prying eyes of foreign governments or competition. The best advice we can give you here is to use very strong passwords on all devices. We do--as a matter of policy--enforce requirements for passwords that should address this issue. In addition, if there are any documents you may need to review during travel, print them out in hard copy so that while being processed at borders, your phone and laptop can be turned off. That way, if you aren't compelled to unlock them for search, the sensitive data on the devices will not be available on any networks to grab. Finally, if you should have your device confiscated from you by a foreign authority, please report it immediately to the IT department, as the assumption is it will be compromised, and we have ways of wiping the devices remotely to limit the ability for them to access sensitive information.

Thanks again for your time, and please do reach out if you have any questions, or need further specific advice as to how to protect your devices and sensitve data.

All the best,
Eric Andrade
