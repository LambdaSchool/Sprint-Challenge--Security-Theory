Attention: IT Staff.

As the summer holidays come to an end, we are gearing up for the upcoming school year. Part of our efforts to ensure an excellent student and teacher experience has been a large purchase order containing brand new computers for all teachers and student facilities (i.e. computer labs, libraries). Your supervisors will assign specific tasks to ensure we safeguard all machines against possible threats from competitor schools, identity thieves, disgruntled parents/students, or other types of organized crime groups . Some things to note:


Internet access will be one of the largest attack surfaces. We need to update content filters to ensure that sites which rank high on our security threat model are restricted and that no malicious malware is able to gain remote access. 

Our proprietary software also needs to enforce access control policies. Users should be provided with minimum level of access necessary to do their job. At the end of the day, access should be revoked to prevent attacks originating from personal devices, or in the event that the security of our premises gets compromised after business hours. 

All school staff should be educated about phishing scams as emails are our main method of communication and also a major attack surface. 

Please keep the aforementioned items in mind as we all prepare to welcome our students and education staff.

Sincerely,  \nIqra Javed  \nCyber Security Engineer
