Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model:


Janice is a 18 year old Theatre student in NYC. She is very active in her community and is the appointed treasurer for her musical theatre group. The group does lots of fundraising events and are saving up to put on their own performance. They have raised almost $20,000. Janice is also very big into social media and has never been super concerened about privacy. She does her best to log out of any bank accounts she runs, but she does have all of her personal passwords and treasurer passwords saved in her "Notes" app on her phone. She lives with 5 other people in a loft downtown, 3 of which she doesn't know well or speak to all that often. 


Janice could be attacked via her phone or school on the free WIFI via her laptop pretty easily since she has the passwords just saved in her notes app. She could easily be attacked while at home or during class with other people all around. Her adversaries could be one of the 3 people she lives with and doesn't know very well. Or possibly someone in her acting club that doesn't like her and could mess with the funds of their account. Or, maybe a stranger who knows about the fundraiser via social media and see's that Janice runs it. She could most likely be hacked on her socials, over wifi, or directly from her phone. My advice to Janice would be to get a password manager to protect her personal finances and especially the club's funds. She should have not have any personal information accessible on her phone. She also should get to know the people she is living with a bit better, and maybe buy a secure lock for her bedroom for when she's not at home.
