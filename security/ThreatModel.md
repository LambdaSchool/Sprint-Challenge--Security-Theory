Tim is the CEO of a new tech company that is developing a Fitness app. Through it, users can engage in fitness competitions for money. After a fight at their fancy office, Tim's business partner Josh leaves the company with a vendetta against Tim. Because Tim has lost his business partner(and the money he brought with him), he panics and believes Stripe is now out of what the company can afford, so he pays a developer he hired on craigslist to handle credit card charges, instead of using Stripe's enterprise package. 

In this scenario, the attack surface would be the fitness app(through the payments), as well as any sensative information that could be lying around the office. Adversaries include Josh, potentially the craigslist dev(it can be assumed he was not properly vetted). Since Josh still has access to the office, he may choose to go there and sabotage/destroy the physical computers on which the development has taken place. The CL dev could have written a keylogger or have written code that is vulnerable to be keylogged. In this situation, there are many steps that can be taken to mitigate potential damage. First, if finances are a problem, cut costs on useless things, like a fancy office. This mitigates Josh's access to vulnerable items. Money saved could go into using a more secure API, such as Stripe. 


MBP REDO:
Reynad is a professional Hearthstone streamer and CEO of a gamer organization called TempoStorm. He streams playing Hearthstone several hours every day, and is extremely unlikeable, because he complains a lot about everything. This is essentially a persona however, to attract views to his channel,which is extremely successful despite his audience's negative opinion. He has been has been on the recieving end of DDoS attacks several times. He has done drunk streams where he lets personal information slip. Despite these problems with the streaming aspect of his career, his role as CEO is unquestionably a good one. There are no issues with security, and everything related to TempoStorm runs like a fine-tooth comb.

Reynad's main issue is that he seemingly accepts the security risks against him, and he allows it through his behavior. For now, it seems to be working for him, but if attackers were able to get his stream down for significant periods of time, it could affect his subscription/view numbers, which could lead to less streaming income. His adversaries inculde internet trolls who wish to attack him for their own enjoyment, bad faith rival streamers who wish to see his profile deminished if they can take down his stream with a DDoS. Reynad has several options in terms of mitigating his damage, although, it is unlikely that he will do these, they are: change his persona. If Reyand decided to be more professional, less sarcastic and salty, or more competitive and elated when he wins, he would likely be a more likeable person, and less open to attacks, however, being a public persona on the internet is unfortunetly a role which perpetually makes you a target for trolls, so Reyand will likely continue this as he considers it a calculated risk that has so far worked out for him.
