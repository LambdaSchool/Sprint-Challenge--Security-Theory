Dylan is a college student who depends on all kinds of online services to get through his day. He has social media accounts for facebook, twitter and instagram. He has school accounts for his .edu email and his university's student portal. He also has online banking to make it more convenient to pay for school. The list goes on, including all his personal accounts and scetchy websites for getting cheaper textbooks. He uses the same password and username for all of his accounts to make things easy and simple. He never has to click the "I forgot my password" button, and is able to access everything he needs, when he needs it. Dylan hasn't set up any 2-factor authorization either because he's a busy guy. Plus he never tells anyone his password, and since it's so easy to remember he hasn't written it down anywhere. He should be safe, right?

Dylan hasn't done much to protect his accounts, so he really isn't that safe from online threats. His most obvious **attack surface** is that he uses the same account name and password for everything. His password is also easy to crack because it is simple enough for him to remember it. Although Dylan is a pretty nice guy overall and hasn't made any direct enemies, he still has **adversaries** like cyber criminals and frat boys at his school. His main concern should be criminals online who just want access to his accounts so they can steal any personal information they can get. **Attack vectors** for these cyber criminals to hack Dylan's account include brute force attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and dictionary attacks. Dylan's password isn't strong so a brute force attack could easily compromise it. His password could also be retrieved from a local scumbag if Dylan connects to the wrong wifi at a coffee shop or his university. Once a criminal has his password for one site, they can use it on all of the other sites that Dylan has made accounts on. In order for Dylan to **mitigate** these types of attacks, he needs to drastically change his approach to security. The simplest steps he could take would be to take advantage of 2-factor authentication on all of his accounts. He should also make his passwords different across all sites, and make them longer so they aren't so easy to bruteforce. A password manager could be useful to Dylan, so he can keep up his busy work schedule without compromising his security.
