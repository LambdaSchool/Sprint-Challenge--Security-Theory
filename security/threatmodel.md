SECURITY ADVISION

Dear Ms. Cohen, 

	My name is Robert Hogan. I am you new cyber security advisor for your small business. Throughout my assessment of your company’s security implementations, I have come upon a few points of interest that I feel need to be brought to your attention, and require some modifying. My job is to secure you, and your network from various online attacks, from pranksters, and criminals alike. Currently your company is only running an antivirus program, specifically “bitdefender” on all computer devices. I have also noticed that your personal computer, and all of your employee’s computers are connected to your open network. While there are benefits to your customers in having an open Wi-Fi connection that they are able to connect to, connecting your personal devices, and work devices belonging to you and all of your employees is a major flaw in your company’s online security.  But not to worry, that’s what I’m here for! 

Here’s what I have found for security flaws in my assessment:

-	All employees personal and work computers are connected top the open Wi-Fi meant to be used by the customers.
-	The only current means of Internet security is a version of “bitdefender” running on all work computers.
-	The company-wide idea that “No hacker has interest in a small business because we have nothing of value to a hacker”.

Now as far as how to correct these issues, I have a few steps in mind that we will be taking. To begin, we need to eradicate the idea that “We as a small business have nothing of value for a hacker”. This is the single most important piece of the puzzle that we need to fit. Every small business has something of value to a hacker, and I will explain what that is…it is your own files, and systems that have the potential to be held for “ransom”.  These types of attacks are extremely likely for small businesses, especially if you have an open Wi-Fi connection, such as yourself, with all of your work computers attached to it. The attacker will have the ability to encrypt all of your files and information, and lock you out until you decide to pay them. After you pay them, who knows if they will really unencrypt your files so you can start serving your customers again? The only way to get around this is to stop it from happening in the first place! 

	The second step is to begin securing your network! To do this, we will need to upgrade your network security. We need to first, introduce an encrypted network for you and your employees to connect to. We will use one of the following to help reduce the risk of your connections becoming compromised: WEP encryption, WAP encryption, WAP2 encryption. This will allow you to have peace of mind, while still having a secondary open Wi-Fi for your customers to connect to and enjoy. 
This will make it more difficult for anyone trying to connect to any endpoint (device) that you have attached to your network, and make it more difficult for him or her to introduce any malicious content into the network. 

	The third step is to accept the fact that only having “bitdefender” on each work computer is not enough security.  There are plenty of “back doors” or methods to gain access to any device on your network, that have the ability to be undetectable by any antivirus platform, and will allow a hacker full access to anything on any computer that they want. To correct this, we will introduce some training in cyber security to you, and all of your employees. We will go into risk assessment so it’s easier to identify what should, and should not be trusted to click on. Password managers, to help secure employees passwords more efficiently, and how to properly manage suspicious files or links. 

	The final step will be to run some pen testing on your network and devices.
This will be done by me, personally, and will be conducted in your presence only. We will test the ability of a hacker to break into your network to be sure that we have the proper network security settings and tools, and we will also attempt to break into your work devices to see if your employees are properly trained in their risk-assessment to manage potential back doors. 

I very much look forward to working with you in securing your company from any and all potential online threats! Thank you very much for your time!

Sincerely, 
Robert Hogan. 
Security Advisor.
