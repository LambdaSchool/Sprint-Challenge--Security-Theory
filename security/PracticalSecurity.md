The most practical security improvement is 2 factor auth. In the event your password is compomised, a bad actor still requires additional proof to access your data.
Passwords themselves aren't a good method for security. Good ones aren't memorable, but also should'nt be kept noted anywhere. Using a password manager(KeepPass) can solve that issue.
