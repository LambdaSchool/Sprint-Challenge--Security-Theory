Anti-Virus Software
This may be hard to believe, but I have been running without an anti-virus since my last OS install, back about 7 months ago!  Well... unless you count Bit Defender...  heh...  Today I tried Total AV, but the ad spam within the first 30 minutes was atrocious.  Back to Sophos Home.  Fuller protection than Total AV, including real time protection, ransomware protection, and malicious traffic detection, all on their free service.  Oh, and no obnoxious advertisements.  All I get is a simple little banner at the top of my UI, letting me know there's a 20% discount for the next 5 days, and I got one small gray box, letting me know how long I have my free trial of premium left.  It also found more potential threats than Total AV.  I am happy with Sophos.

Password Manager
But...  why use a password manager at all?  I'll just use the same password for everything, for ease of access for me.  After all, I don't visit pornographic sites, so I wont ever be hacked.  Right?
Yeah.  That's where I was at.  That's what I was doing.  Now, I am using about 5 different passwords, but still... not hard to gain control of a good portion of my life with just 5 passwords, all of which are under 10 characters.  Time to take care of that.  Enter, Dashlane.
Not just a password, but a pass phrase!  I was going to use that one, but I'm giving it to you for free, so I'll use another one.  Now I can have Dashlane generate passwords for me, so they can be tremendously long, and fairly unhackable to everyone but the most extremely determined hacker.
It also saves stuff online, so I can put my security in the hands of a company that has more time to spend on security than I do.

2 Factor Authentication
Now this, I actually have in effect.  I use this for my Steam account.  Since this is all online, I appreciate the extra effort Steam has taken to help protect (at this point) a few hundred dollars worth of software and games.  In order to log in from a new computer, you need access to my cell phone.  To log in, Steam sends my phone a 5 or so digit code that is only good for less than a minute.

Physical Security
Cyber security goes beyond just passwords and virus protection.  If somebody can install a thumb drive, or get in to your papers, they can get your information and/or steal your identity.  My lock was mainly to keep my kids out of the computer after they destroyed two different printers, but it's also a great deterrent against thieves.  They want easy access in and out.  Hit and run, grab what you can.  If it's not easy to get inside, they'll probably leave it alone.  Unless they think there's something truly valuable inside.

Password Protected LAN
Another thing that I always had, was a password protected LAN.  However, time to change it, because it is the same password, reused yet again...  Look up what your LAN router's address, and go sign in, and change it from the default password.

Limited Use of Devices
Also a help, so that we don't have to worry about every single device, is that we only use specific devices to do specific things.  My desktop is the hub, so we do pretty much everything on it.  But phones, we limit to specific apps.  No eBay or online shopping on the phones.  The laptop is for the kids, so nothing adult goes on there.  No credit cards, no passwords, nothing, unless it's for the kids.  However, these devices have access to the LAN, so make sure to set up some basic security on your other devices, so it doesn't act like a back door to something more important (like my desktop).

Keep going!
Now, this is just the beginning of setting up some basic security for your online presence.  If you're interested in getting further into securing your digital information, dig deeper, and find out more!  Here's a good start:

SSH Keys
GPG Keys
