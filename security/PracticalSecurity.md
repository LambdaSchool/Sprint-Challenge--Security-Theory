# Measures implemented to increase security stregth of my computer and my other devices that may or may not be connected accounts that are conntected to services that provide email or cloud storage that could potentially harbor sensitive information that are related to IT work or personal stuff as well as social media

~~I've stopped using all computers and smartphone devices and sent myself back to stone age, severing myself from using any form of technologies ever again.~~

## Measures taken
- Implemented 2-factor-auth for services that provide such security measure (e.g. google, blizzard)

- Discourage autofill username and password for accounts that store important files or conversations.

- Pick a suitably long passphrase to protect your password manager.

- Started using password manager - KeePass ~~(It will be deleted in 3 days' time)~~
