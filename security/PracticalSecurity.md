## Security Improvement
I decided to download keepass to store my passwords rather than having my web browser doing it. I also went ahead and updated a few of my passwords to something more secure.

I installed keepass, set up a log in, added some log in credentials and tested the auto-fill. I was also updating some important passwords to something much more secure while I was adding them to keepass.
