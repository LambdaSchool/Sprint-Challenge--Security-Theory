I use 2 factor authentication with my main credentials for google. I change my passwords from time to time, my passwords use many different characters (not just alpha numeric), and are very long. Personally, I don't really trust password managers, as it's a one point of failure. From my perspective, if one fails, the others won't. I don't use the same passwords for websites. So if there's a vulrebility, known or unknown, there's only one that's compromised, makes it harder for individuals or malicious state sponsors. I already have ssh keypairs, and I can deny access to devices if desired. I have a VM, qemu (kernel based virtual machine, with almost bare metal performance) from Fedora. Qemu as a virtual machine is much more powerful than what Windows or VMWare has available (that's free), although VMWare might have paid versions that are better, but I haven't tried (as it's very expensive). Overall, I do security best practices, so that helps a lot to make my data more secure.
