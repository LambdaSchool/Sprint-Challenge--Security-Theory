I already have a premium LastPass account so I took the opportunity to retake the Security Challenge and worked on updating passwords that were compromised or too weak. I changed my Master Password snd took some time to bump up my "Security Score." I have some more cleaning up to do, but I have a good start. 

I also have two factor authentication set up on several accounts.
