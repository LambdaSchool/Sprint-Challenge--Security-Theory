I genereate a SSh key and setup this in Github.

I tested the connection via the terminal but I am not yet aware
on how to use it with a real repo.

I get the idea behind the SSH key share, even though I do not fully inderstand
all the internal steps.

I fell happy with this setup, it woth alwaus the time improving personal security.
