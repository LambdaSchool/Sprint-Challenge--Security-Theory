# Practical Security

With world moving to laptop and mobile, securing personal information (PII, password, id, bank details) is more important than ever. It is very easy to memorize one password than 20 different passwords and use it for almost all sites. This is red flag for user and it takes only 1 mistake to compromise password and handing over all your personal information to attacker.

Personally, I do not like to use same password for all sites. However, I do not want to memorize all passwords at the same time. I prefer Last Pass for storing passwords. I have not tried any other password managers as I found using Last Pass very convinient. I can use it on my mobile and laptop. Chrome and Firefox provides browser extension which is very convinient. Also, I can generate secure password using numbers, alphabets and special characters. If I choose, I can auto fill login information when I visit website. This makes login faster than ever. However, I would highly recommend to use LastPass with two-factor authentication as nothing is 100% secure.

Moving away from password security for a while, I have following setup on my laptop.

- I have SSH key for pushing commits to github. I found this very convinient as I do not have to enter login id / password every time I push something to github.
- I like to work on linux sometimes. However, I do not want to install multiple OS my laptop. Virtualbox comes as rescue. I use Ubuntu image on Virtualbox. I highly recommend reading online documentation specially for configuration part as using incorrect config will slow down your virtual OS considerably.
