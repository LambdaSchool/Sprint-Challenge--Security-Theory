Since I am not using my primary laptop I will skip adding security for my system for now. Instead, I will talk about what I will do! I will download keypass, then run an antivirus scan. Then create my private (ultimate) key and start adding randomly generating new passwords for all of the apps and websites that I use. I will look for all of the applications that I use that are able to use google's two-factor-authentication and I will install it on my phone, then set it up for those websites.
