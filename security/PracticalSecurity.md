In order to improve the quality of my personal security, I have downloaded the open-source password manager KeePass. This way, instead of my current situation where the passwords to all my accounts are mostly the same, leaving them veulnerable to attackers - for if an attacker figures out one password they can easily guess all the others - I will have seperate passwords for each account. I have protected the password manager with a suffciently long password of 27 charachters, which should make it significantly harder for a criminal to crack using brute force.
