As far as securing my own setup goes, the most simplest thing I've done was setting up a strong passphrase. Before I had a 8 character password with a number here and there, but have ultimately decided to make it stronger. By turning it in to a 19 character pass phrase filled with incoherent words, I'm sure I've made it at least a billion times stronger. I can also opt to setup a keypass type of service. This service should make passwords for all my accounts that require passwords and encrypt them. I just setup a really strong passphrase for that keypass service and it should be extremely secure. I can also setup 2 factor for my accounts, which would force me to enter another temporary password that's sent to my personal device everytime I want to login.
