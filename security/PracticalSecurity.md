# Practical Security

## Securing your accounts important first steps

Technology is constantly changing and the amount of new services that improve us lives
seems to increase by the day. Almost everyone has an email account, or a netflix account,
or some other service that requires a secure password to keep them safe. But most people
hardly give any thought to their passwords often choosing passwords for convenience and not security.

This is going to be a simple guide to securing your accounts and thinking about how to
secure your environment without sacrificing convenience.

The most important thing you can do is protect your gateway accounts like your email. Email accounts
are particularly important because someone can use it to impersonate you and possibly gain access you
any of your connected accounts. One way to add an extra layer of security is to use two-step authentication
on your account. Most email providers have this as an option in your account settings and setup is fairly
quick and easy.

Another step that can be taken is setting up a password manager to create stronger passwords for all
your accounts. This has the benefit of centralizing your passwords under a one convenient place and
now you only have to remember and create one strong password.

There are tons of other way and many more steps you can take you secure your accounts but at a minimum you
should do the things mentioned above.
