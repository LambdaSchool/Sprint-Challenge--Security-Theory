This sprint has been interesting for me, as I recently had a malware-related incident that necessitated a completely clean slate. I have experimented with password managers in the past, but have encountered situations where I had to migrate services (or lost 100% of my data) so many times during my life that I am unwilling to offload any important password to a software database. For example, after experiencing it once, I decided that I should never be in a situation where I don't have my gmail and facebook passwords memorized.

Last year, I found an excellent compromise when I discovered a plugin for KeePass called "passphrase generator". It essentially generated nonsense phrases in english, which turn out to be highly secure due to their large length. I have since lost access to that particular database of passwords, but not before memorizing what I now consider to be my "master password". I feel fortunate to be living in the current technological environment, where any password is ephemeral and can be reset as long as I remember my master password.

I'm aware that my personal security could be far better, and I hope that as I mature, my habits settle down and I stop losing all my data to viruses, moving, acts of god, and negligence, but until then I'm just glad that quantum computers can't open my gmail account just yet.
