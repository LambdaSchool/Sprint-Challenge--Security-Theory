# Csaba Balogh Sprint challenge

## Part 1

Ester is a 30 years old opera singer with several shows around the country. She keeps her schedule, banking information, connections online. During the shows her case with her phone is unattended in the changing rooms. One guard keeps attention on the room, but this is not the guard main tasks to do, and usually there is a huge mass around those rooms.

Ester's phone is not well protected and anybody who puts hand on the phone could log in to her accounts, including her emails where she can request password reminders.

The city where she lives also famous about pocket pickers.

In Ester's situation there are several risk factors. Her phone could easily be stolen away by her competition, pocket pickers and other people who simply wants to earn some quick money. The phone is not protected either by PIN or fingerprint reader.

## Improve Estes' security

1. Phone should be protected by finger print reader.
2. Email should be protected by 2 step verification.
3. Setting up an account where Ester could erase her phone from home knowing her password.
4. Online Banking info should not be saved on her phone/ in the history at all.
5. Always go to incognito mode when logging in to an account,a dn use different passwords for banking and email. Don't store username/password
6. By doing this, it won't give enough time to figure out any password, since it will be erased and changed in time.
