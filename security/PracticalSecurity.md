Before this assignment I defenitely wasn't as secure with my passwords as I should have been. Although I made sure all of my passwords were different and I didn't tell anyone what they are, I was too lazy to use 2-step verification for most of my accounts. Since I don't want to be compromised however, I made sure to take the assignment, and my security, seriously. I started off by adding 2-step verification to my most important accounts. Google makes this easy with their 2-step verification service that doesn't require me to remember another password. It sends a notification to my phone with a code that I can use to log in to my accounts. Then I downloaded KeePass password manager which I can use for storing passwords as well as creating strong random passwords. It took a little while to learn the best practices for using this program, but I made sure to complete the most essential parts to beef up my security. I created a very long and hard to crack master password to protect all of my other information. I also created some new throw away accounts so I could practice using the random password generator and auto-fill function. These are both helpful for creating virtually unbreakable passwords for a multitude of sites, and I don't have to remember a single one. My passwords are much more secure now, but there is still more I can do to protect my information which I will work on.
