# Practical Security
Implemented the use of a password manager DashLane with a very long
and private passphrase, which prompted me to perform a security 
assessment and displayed all my accounts that currently had saved 
the passwords into the browsers. Eliminated and cleared browser 
cache, then proceeded to change every single password with a 
40+ characters randomly generated passwords using (PWGEN). Backed 
up an encrypted copy of all my passwords and uploaded it to google 
drive for safe keeping and burned another copy into a DVD. Cleaned 
up my GitHub access tokens, and old SSH keys. Refreshed GitHub SSH 
keys for currently using machines only. Set-Up 2 form 
Authentication on all my emails, and bank accounts.
