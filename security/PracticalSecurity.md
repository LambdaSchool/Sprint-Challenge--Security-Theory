Thanks to Lambda School i got more mindful of issues with security altough i already had some knowledge about it and potential dangers.

I try to use secure and long phrase passwords for important services like PayPal, banking and other valuable software/web services.

I tend to use throaway passwords for things that can get hacked and pose no danger and have no real value to me.

I also use 2 or even 3 step authentication in most online video games that are more prone to attacks due to value that attacker can get.

I never used password managers because i am still unsure about their inside security and i prefer to trust my own brain and memory, but maybe it will change soon.

I also use 2-step authentication for important e-mail accounts that act like another wall against hacking.

I just now configured ssh key pairs for github as Sprint Exercise.
