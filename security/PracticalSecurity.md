Regarding the assertion in the readme that it is safe to publish our security measures to
github:

Shannon's maxim states that  is that the *design* of a security system should be sound under
the assumption that "the enemy knows the system".  That *does not* mean that we should
just publish everything about our security setups.  Obscurity should not be our
primary source of security, but it can be an extra layer on top of a sound system.
It is undeniably harder for an attacker to get started the less information he has
about what he's attacking.

And yes, I do see the irony in writing my threat model about myself and then
quibbling that point.

I have decided to experiment with keepass as an alternative to my current
cloud based password management solution.
