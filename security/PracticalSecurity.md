I implemented 4 new security measures to improve the security of my devices and minimize my exposure to cyberthreats, which I discuss in detail below:

1. 2-factor authentication 
Google has a 2-factor authentication application which several applications I use offer as a way to enhance security. I set it up for several videogame applications (Runescape and World of Warcraft) as well as my email and social media accounts. 

2. Reworking passwords to passphrases
I used to use a very basic password for most of my login accounts, but instead created a pattern which I can create passphrases from which are both unique and complex (per several password-strength-checkers online) and memorable. 

3. Discovered open-source alternatives to proprietary software.
I switched from windows on my laptop to a Linux-system called Fedora, and exchanged several microsoft office applications with open-source alternatives such as libreoffice. I also switched my web browser to firefox and my search engine to duckduckgo, to reduce the overall size of my attack surface.

4. Installed an ad-blocker
I installed ublock origin on all my devices and have the most restrictive settings selected to reduce my digit footprint, limit tracking, and minimize my exposure to malicious third-party software that may load on websites.
