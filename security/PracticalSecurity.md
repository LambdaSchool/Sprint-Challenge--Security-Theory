After studying about security, encryption and the threats caused by poor password management, I decided to create a password locker. Using one of the suggested applications in our Sprint, I set up a database for my existing passwords and added key file to access it. Although stronger than a passphrase, it still doesn't make it 100% secure but rather more difficult for a hacker to access the database. It provides another layer to bypass. Rather than having to know the passphrase, the key is something that I have that provides me access to the locker.

I have configured 2 factor authentication for my Google and Yahoo accounts. When I log into either account, a text is sent to my phone with a code that has to be entered before I am allowed to access those sites. I also receive a text asking if I am trying to access these accounts and I need to confirm. Once again, not 100% safe but it adds more complexity.
