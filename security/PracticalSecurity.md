# Personal Practical Security
### Password Manager
- Setup LastPass
- Generated Passwords for Banks, Bills, Github, Twitter, AWS, Amazon
- TODO: connect rest of accounts that contain personal info of some kind

### 2-Factor Authentication
- I've setup 2 Factor Authentication for my apple devices
- Specifically between my macbook and iphone

### Connecting to GitHub with SSH
- I've set up personal computer and laptop to be able to connect through SSH
- Essential now that my GitHub pasword is like 70 characters long lol
