# The Keys to Everything

Nothing is worse than losing a key to your car and looking around for it only to have to call your boss and tell him you'll be late. At that point you might as well make up some excuse because who honestly wants to say it's because they misplaced their key? Well, it's the same kind of embarassment when you forget your login to check in onto the company's online time clock. Now, if that password becomes compromised by an individual with malicious intent, that embarassment can become serious damage.

## Logins and Passwords everywhere

Logins for social media, for work, for games, Amazon, Spotify, anything that needs to identify you as you and withhold special information from anyone but you. Ideally, you should have different passwords for each service. You also should not be writing these down or keeping them in a notepad file on your desktop. "So how can I remember all of these passwords if you're telling me I can't write them down?" Well, that's where your password manager comes into play.

### Password Managers

Password managers are apps that organize all of your passwords in one secure location and for anyone who is familiar with online security, they are definitely passionate about them. "So you're telling me to put all of my eggs in one basket?"

Yep. Realistically though, that basket is an impenetrable fortress with people dedicated to maintaining that level of security for everyone using the app. All it requires of you is to sign up with a username, a password and to download the service onto your browser(s) of choice and/or your phone. For a list of the best password managers (I use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)), check here: https://alternativeto.net/software/keepass/

### Two-Factor Authentication

Just this morning I received an email from Facebook that my new password request was received and to click the link included. I knew I did not request a new password and immediately discarded the message, but fortunately I have two-factor authentication equipped on each of my most sensitive apps that provide it. This adds another dynamic method of securing yourself against malicious individuals.

By signing up for two-factor auth, you will receive a message (via email or mobile) everytime a new login is received with a special code to enter. By entering this code you are releasing the final lock on the account so that you may access it. This could very well be the last line of defense in an attack and is most definitely worth the extra few minutes to setup appropriately.
