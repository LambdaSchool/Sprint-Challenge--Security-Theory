The truth is, I didn't do any of these things to protect myself. For one, 2-Factor Auth is a nuisance, having to put two passwords in every time I want to log in to something. For every layer of security I put on my accounts, that's just another layer I have to 'crack' to get into my accounts and it's even more passwords to have to remember. In this instance, I'd end having to create a word document with all my usernames and passwords and if, by chance, my system managed to get hacked, someone could find that file and know all my passwords anyway. Not to mention that someone has my data anyway if I was to use a cloud service for password protection.

I guess it's all about making it more difficult for the attacker, but it's a zero sum game. We're always having to one up the hacker and it's becoming more and more inconvenient for the user. Honestly, there has to be a better way to build passwords and security to protect user data. Right?
