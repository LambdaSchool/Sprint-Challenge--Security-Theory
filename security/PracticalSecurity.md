--> Downloaded/isntalled KeePass. Used the bits calculations to determine a good master password and then used it's password generator to replace all my active account's passwords on any site that contains any sensitive information related to myself. Printed the emergency sheet and stored in a secure location the master password to the DB storing all these newly refreshed passwords.

--> Did some basic research on what Kali Linux is and what it is used for. Liked what I saw and plan to start using the site https://kali.TRAINing/ as the foundation to learn how to use the System. I feel that in the process of learning Kali (used for penetration testing), ill be able to keep in mind in the future if any of my actions could be a potential attack surface and try to limit them from its onset rather than fixing it later.
