To improve your personal security:

Think about the sorts of threats we should worry about such as:
 
 Common criminals, botnets malware, the stealing of your files & DDoS-ing your service.
 Also consider whether or not to use a service, if you do decide to use a service consider 
 history & reputation as well as what countries it operates in.

 To keep things in tact follow the steps below and use as many as you choose:
 
    * set up a password manager
    * SSH keypairs for services that support it
    * GPG keypair
    * Use a simple dedicated hardware for second factor
    * Use a Virtual machine running only open source software
    * Use sandboxed" environment for web browsing that doesn't save state
