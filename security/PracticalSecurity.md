Implementing the use of KeePass as my password manager which generates unique, long, and complex passwords for
each of my accounts. At first it may be troublesome to remember this one long complex password, but it is definitely
worthwhile to secure valuable information and prevention of security threats.

In the near future I do plan on enabling two factor authentication for services that offer it. In order to login to the
system it requires a secondary device to be used in conjunction with my login and password. Upon the login attempt, the
system will send a unique code to the secondary device which I must enter within a certain duration in order to login.
