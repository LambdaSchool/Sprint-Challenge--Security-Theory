I used my Norton Accounts free password manager to hold my passwords. I also changed several old passwords (which were all the same) to newer, longer passwords. I used the method of combing three random words(capitalized), two numbers and a symbol to create strong passwords. I also created a two-factor authentication for some of my acccounts which will text me a code that I must enter before logging in.
