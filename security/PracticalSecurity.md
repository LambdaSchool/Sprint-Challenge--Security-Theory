First I had to decide which password manager I wanted to use. The options in todays repository were very nice
and helped me form opinions about other password managers I've heard of in the past. While KeePass seems very nice
and is supposedly one of the top four password managers used in the modern digital world, I feel like I want my
password manager to be an extension of my browser while also being able to store anything else I want, such as
documents or manually entered passwords for a service that may not be part of my browser. For this reason I
decided to go with LastPass. This is a service I have used in the past so I am already a member but unfortunately
have not kept with so I have a lot of security-updating to do today.
