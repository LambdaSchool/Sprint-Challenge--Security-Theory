To better my security for my digital footprint I downloaded KeePass. It has always been an issue with me trying to remember passwords and passphrases so I had just been using the same password for everything. That's why I like this KeePass idea, I can now keep hard to remember and guess passwords all in one place knowing that they will be safe.

So first, I started changing my passwords to all my major logins on sites that could have comprimising information. Then I also set up two-factor authentication. Then I went into the KeePass terminal and started setting up the database with all my new passwords to websites. Now I feel my information is much more secure!
