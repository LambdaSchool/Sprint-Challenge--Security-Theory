KeePass:
I downloaded and installed KeePass, and I am going to start going through the websites that I use on a regular basis and saving those passwords in KeePass. Until now, I have been using a browser extension to manage my passwords. I have read that this mode of password management is more secure than writing it down on paper or desktop note, but is also less secure than using a third party password management platform. 
Kali Linux:
I have only just started to learn Linux (Ubuntu), but I am in a separate program for security, and I have heard a lot about the Kali Linux distro as the go-to for penetration testers. I just need to find/buy a flash drive that doesn't have anything important on it so I can make a boot of Kali and start experimenting with it. 
Github SSH:
I _think_ I am connected to Github SSH; when I clone repos, I can clone either through HTTPS or SSH. I cannot remember if I set up SSH login during the precourse work or not, so I will have to look into it a bit more.
