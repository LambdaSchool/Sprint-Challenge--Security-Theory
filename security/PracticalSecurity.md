## Some of personal security setup:

- KeePass - I use MiniKeePass run on phone, to keep all of my passwords safe
- Two Factor Auth - I use this for Gmail and Github account. I likely use these two accounts at different devices at different location, so it is best to have it setup.
- Connecting to GitHub with SSH
