For the practical security Section, I chose not to make a password manager, because I feel like a I already follow good password conventions. The first password I ever used was a simple word, all lowercase, no numbers, no symbols. According to http://www.passwordmeter.com, it recieves a 6% score. Obviously that's a terrible score. Over the years however, most companies have required you make more complex passwords. In college,because WoW made me, I complicated my simple password(but continued to use it for everything I needed), which according to http://www.passwordmeter.com, my upgraded password scored 71%. Nowadays however that is not enough. More recently, my password practices have continued to evolve, and now I have a system which mutates my original password into something unique enough to not be able to crack, yet memorable enough that I can remember it, and if I can't remember it for some reason, they're all handwritten in a notebook in a locked file cabinet in my house. According to http://www.passwordmeter.com, all my current passwords are 100%. I should mention, my email password follows a completely different convention, since it is more/less the most important password I have, due to it being where I have important things set to. 


MBP REDO:
I have been using Blizzard's two-step authentication for 10 years, since it launched in 2008. To the best of my knowledge, their original implmentation for World of Warcraft(what I was using it for in 2008) was, to the best of my knowledge, the first popular use of two-step authentication. It was originally done with a dedicated device similar to a beeper, but a few years later with the rise of smartphones, an app was released, and is still available on App Stores today, covering all Blizzard games.

Here's a short article from 2008 about the launch of Two-Step Auth:
