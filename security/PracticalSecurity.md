## Practical Security

Our family take security issue quite seriously.  We miminize access social media, never click on any links or game that post on the social media.  We use password management to help us to manage our password.  We change passwords regulary and they all long and complex. And we also use authentication app from google that will generate pins and send to our phones to varify that we are the one who sign in the applications like banking app or email.

My husband sets up SSH to our internet router. My next step is have him to teach me how to set up SSH for my application account.
