I am currently using LastPass as a password manager to manage all websites that I have account with.  Websites that I no longer use have their passwords changed and accounts shut down and deactivated (if supported).  I do have some security concerns with LastPass as it is a cloud based service, however the convenience and reliability have worked well for me.

I use 2FA whenever possible that is linked to an authenticator app on my phone, with a phyiscal copy of recovery codes in case I ever lose the device.

I have experience setting up and using SSH keys with cloud hosting services (AWS,DO, etc), as well as using VirtualBox and VMware to set up test environments.

As far as improving my security I will be looking into creating a GPG key, as GitHub is a platform that is part of my daily routine and it is in my best interest to keep my data secure as possible.
