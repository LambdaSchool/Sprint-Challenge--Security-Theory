# Practical Security

## The first steps to a more secure environment 

Wherever we go, we are accompanied by technology. 
But if we are honest with ourselves, the most average users like we are care a lot more
about usability and convenience rather than chosing long complicated passwords and
typing them every time we want to check our e-mails.

This guide aims to give you the tools to have a more secure environment while still 
have the convenience on your side! 

The most important thing first: Your e-mail account.
Since these can not only be used to impersonate you, but also to "recover" any password
from any service you are using protecting them is a high priority!
The good news:
It is fairly easy for us to put an extra layer of security on top of it, without having to do much!

Enabling 2 factor authentication will take you mere minutes and you still only have to authenticate
each of your devices once!
What it ngives you is protection from normal outside attacks because token based (via an app) 2FA
is very hard to get around.
