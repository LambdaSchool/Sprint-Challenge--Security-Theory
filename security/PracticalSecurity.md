I've implemented 2Factor Authentication on all my important accounts. 
I also use a password generator to create 50digit + passwors & allow Google password manager safely store those passwords. My password for my Google account contains over 15 digits, upper & lower case, special characters, no words or any other information related to me or my background
I've also implemented SSH keys for my github account. I'm in the process of creating GPG keys
I've installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox
