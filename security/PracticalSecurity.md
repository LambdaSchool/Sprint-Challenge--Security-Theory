### Practical Security

___

To improve my security, I started by updating all fo my old passwords. I already use a password manager, so this was pretty easy to do. I generated random passwords that were 17-25 characters long. I also created a new passphrase to secure dashlane.

Next, I set up two-factor auth for my gmail and dashlane accounts. I used the app "Authy" to do this.
