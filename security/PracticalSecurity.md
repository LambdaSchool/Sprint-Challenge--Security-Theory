I changed a few of My accounts to 2fa, as well as used Mnemonic phrases to memorize my passwords. I use Google authenticator whenever available. I never use simple passwords and change them often. I never click on unknown links and am very wary when surfing the web and am very concious of misspelled URL's and phishing attempts. Today I changed my bank account passwords and encrypted the password file to my off line portable Harddrive. moved all my Crypto currency keys to a paper wallet.
