In order to better protect myself from malicious attacks on my personal and professional data, I have done the following:

Assessed where my personal and independent work data is stored online. Currently, it is stored across Evernote and Google Drive, which both support two-factor auth, so I feel that is secure.

I have also set up a KeePass password manager to protect and store all of my passwords, from my network and device passwords, to my banking, e-commerce, and other digital sites which require passwords to access items that I have purchased/stored.

I will be setting up a GPG key (maximum key size of 4096) for my GitHub account, so that any software projects that I work on and develop will be protected given my ability to sign my commits.

I have already set up two-factor authentication with my Gmail accounts, so that signing in on other devices requires a confirmation to a message sent to my cell phone to gain access to the accounts.
