This week is my first week learning about security so I didn't do much yet.  I will secure my password later with a password manager.  I would like to learn more about github ssh but don't know much yet about it.  I now understand why it is good to have long password and would start changing my passwords soon.  Nothing is 100 percent safe, but it is always better to have more protection than not.
