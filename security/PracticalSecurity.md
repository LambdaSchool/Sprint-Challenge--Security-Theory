# Part 2 - Practical Security

The security protections I put up on my various accounts are essentially a combination of really complex passwords and 2-factor authentication whenever a service has that feature. I am testing out KeePass on my laptop and I like using it and plan on implementing it on my main desktop. The passphrases I generally use for my actual accounts tend to be really long phrases, hitting around 30-40 characters and different for each major accounts (throwaway accounts with throwaway emails don't count). Having a high WPM helps. I'll probably experiment with 1password since I move around with different computers I own a bit and seeing up KeePass is kind of annoying for each one.
