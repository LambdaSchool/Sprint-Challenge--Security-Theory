One of the first ways I beefed up my own personal cybersecurity is I began using a password manager. While I generally have very strong and lengthy passwords, I often kinda recycle them based on the site I'm using. While this is better than most, I realized that I was still vulnerable to being hacked by someone who had the time and software to try and crack my passwords. 

Another thing that I did that I think a lot of people over look is that I went through my various social media platforms and looked at what other applications I was giving access to my social media and other programs too. While I keep my personal social media accounts pretty secure, that doesn't necessarily mean that thrid-party applications do the same. I was pretty alarmed at the the number of third-party applications that still had access to my account!!! Many of them I had not used for years! I took the time to revoke those apps that no longer needed access, and restricted the information available for the one's that do have access. 

I know that these are not the biggest steps, but I do feel like as I start to become aware of the ways in which I am vulnerable to cybermalice, I will take the necessary precautions to protect myself.
