    Currently I have a password manager setup for all my accounts. What made me get a password manager was to secure any account dealing with money. The more I have learned about security the more I see the need for random long passwords. I also use two factor id whenever possible with a code coming to my phone via text message. I am now looking into GPG with Github to sign my commits. This is an important step as developer to ensure the employer and clients that the data is being kept secure and extra verification from whom the code is coming from.
