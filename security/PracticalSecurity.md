# Personal Security
I downloaded and started using KeePass to keep all my passwords secure and safe. I have realized with using KeePass that I feel more secure and less worrisome about people getting my passwords. I also looked at alternatives to KeePass to see if I really felt good about KeePass. 
I used the two factor authentication with my dropbox account to be very secure with my life.
