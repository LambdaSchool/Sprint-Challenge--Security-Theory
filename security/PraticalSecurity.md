I went through my entire list of cached passwords in Chrome and the brave browser and changed all of my passwords that were repeated or duplicated to increase password security. I reset my passwords for all of my major social media accounts, and I started using a password manager.  I set up SSH for Github, and I switched to Two-Factor Auth for my phone and other hardware. I'm also currenly investing into a VPN to better protect myself online when browsing.
