I started using keypass against better judgment. I suppose this would allow me to change all my passwords to be more abstract than they are. As a software engineer at a tech company I could see why I could be a target to potential theifs. I don't fully understand the big deal behind security but I suppose since my employer will be concerned with it I should as well. 

To be honest by using this keypass software it seems my information/passwords are now more vulnerable than they were when they were in my head. keeping a logged database be it locked or not of all my passwords seems very silly to me and gives attackers one vector to focus all their efforts on. Should they break this vector everything else is compromised nomatter how much effort you put into it. To me it seems much more realistic to choose a long pass phrase somthing you and only you would know. Somthing that has meaning and throw on a special character to the end of it or somthing to meet requirments of security for websites today.
