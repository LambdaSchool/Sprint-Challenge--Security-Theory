# Practical Security

### Situation

I was actually hacked in real life, I check edwww.haveibeenpwned.com and saw that my email was in fact hacked. Since taking this class, I have figured better ways to protect myself and I have implemented KeePass as a password manager for me so I don't have the same passwords for all my accounts. Also for my github, I also use SSH keys so I don't have to supply my username and password on each visit. With my most vital information(banking, credit card) am using two-way authentication ie.. If I try to log in from other locations from my laptop then my account needs a text verification and password. When I write programs, I use Bycrpt and salt rounds to make sure hackers can't hash my password or at least it take many years to figure it out.
