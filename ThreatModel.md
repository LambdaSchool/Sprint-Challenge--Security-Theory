  Good Afternoon Security Team, 

 The prevention of malicious attacks as a fintech institution is paramount as we move to handle more intricate sets of data,and higher volumes of users. In order to mitigate potential attacks and expose vulnerabilities we must take the necessary precautions to ensure success. 
 
 
 ### Attack surface 
 The current software build may leave too wide of a surface of attack. A hacker is a person with as many tools as we have software. In pursuit of a more secure infrastructure, I narrowed down the technologies and features that currently leave us in a vulnerable state without the necessary protocols in place.  
 
 - Database Hosting Services
 - Interface Hosting Services
 - In-house password management
 - User input
 - Routing
 - SQL
 - Employee Error
 - Testing Suites
 - Third Party API's
 

### Adversaries 
As a high profile institution with many partnerships, we are always in a constant state of competition. Along with the allure of a successful company, comes a host of opposition. Identifying our future attackers will further establish trust within our clients. 

- Hackers
- Competition
- Former/Current Employees
- Employee Error
- System Error
- Software (Libraries/Frameworks) Updates
- User Error


### Attack vectors 
Areas of which we can be compromised include the following. 

 - We are using a SQL database with no masking of the routes.
 - User input is also a point of infiltration.
 - Messaging between users and our servers. 
 - Storing their banking information.
 - Storing messages & login information.
 - Third-party transactions.


### Mitigations 
In order to counter these attacks a few solutions we simple to come across but powerful in the aid of prevention. This is not an exhaustive list of tactics but rather a smooth jumping point for further talks and mitigation.

#### Requiring 2-factor authentication from the following areas will dampen the load of potential attacks significantly.

- Login
- Banking Information/Actions
- Password Recovery & Reset
- Administration login
- Developer Pull Requests / Migrations

#### Sanitizing these inputs will also go a long way in preventing attacks

- User input
- Client / Server Routing
- Database ID's & Queries


#### These practices will ensure longevity in our security solutions

- Utilizing Third-Party API's for login, transactions, cloud servers, and serverless architecture. 
- Encrypting any user data that comes in.
- Limits on requests
- Monitors on requests and user input for malicious content. 
- Token/Session expiring / Passwork renewal periodically.
- Testing code to make sure it yeilds the expected out puts
- Hiring pentesters to break and sheild our software. 
- Employee evaluations, perks, and vacations to keep them happy and focused.
- Backups for every data byte introduced to our system. 

In summation I hope the information you have been privied too takes the upmost priority in our journey to a secure system, and healthier company. Please let me know your notes or suggestions in the moving forward with these practice. 

Best Regards,
