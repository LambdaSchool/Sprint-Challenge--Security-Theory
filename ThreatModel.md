Threat Model: Co-located Attacker

There are many ways an attacker may get access to user information, but a co-located attack is one of the hardest to defend against. A co-located attack is where an attacker(or an attacker's malware) and a user have shared the same computer or are located in the same physical location. Although the number of people with personal computers increases year after year and the the threat of co-located attacks decreases from sharing computers, many people continue to use computers in internet cafes, libraries, and in the homes of their friends. These locations can prove threatening. Friends may think it a funny joke to access a Facebook or other social media account and wreak havoc.

One of the more common co-location attacks is the use of a keylogger. Inserting or installing a keylogger in a public computer with security is relatively easy for an experienced attacker. If any passwords or creditcard information is typed by the user, the keylogger will save the data and the attacker may use it at his discretion. 

Keyloggers aren't the only threat. Surveillance can prove just as dangerous as a keylogger. A user in Starbucks may be vulnerabl to surveillance from the attacker sitting at the next table. As technology progresses, so does the quality of small, high-definition cameras. Leaning the credit card number, security digits, and billing information is easy if the surveillance is set up well. 

Fortunately, many sites now require two factor authorization if the login device is unknown. This prevents attackers from accessing, say gmail, even with your password and username.
