Hi Jean,

I wanted to send you some tips on how to keep your social media profiles safe from potential attacks. Lets consider facebook for this scenario. 

Please know that anyone can be the target of an attack, and that being diligent and proactive about your own security is always a good approach. 

Lets consider some places where you may be vulnerable:
-do you have passwords set for all your devices (desktop, smartphone, tablet).
-do you have different passwords to each of these devices? Using your phone or tablets fingerprint reader is a convenient and easy way to ensure that they are secure.
-do you have 2 factor authentication set up?

Who might try to hack into your account?
-often times, people we know are the ones that may try to get into our accounts. While it may seem ok to share passwords, or not be as careful around friend or colleagues, its always best to be diligent in keeping this info private.
-sometimes, you might have an attacker you don't know engage you in a phishing attack, where they send you an email to reset your password. Be sure that emails you'r receiving to reset your passwords are from the authentic source.

How can they get your password, what are attack vectors?
-if your hacker is someone in close proximity to you, you may be showing them your login credentials. Please ensure that you're diligent about not showing anyone this info.
-if your hacker is elsewhere, they may be trying to get you to expose the info via a phishing attack by sending you fake emails and a fake reset password website.

As mentioned above, 2 factor authentication is a great way to mitigate risk. Some other easy ways to prevent exposure is to use your devices fingerprint reader or face/iris scanner. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your sensitive information.

We hope you implement some of these steps to secure yourself from threats, it is critical to our company that you stay focused on your duties at work and minimize distractions, and ensuring digital safety is just one of the ways we keep you safe, and focused!

Best,
Sagar
