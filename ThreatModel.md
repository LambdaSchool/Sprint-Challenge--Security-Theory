As a company we need to start thinking about our threats. In a lot of cases we believe that we are too small for someone to attack us, however, because we are so small we need to really think about all the ways we can be vulnerable. Here are some ways we can start looking at it so we can insure that we are giving the best safe experience for our users.
What do I have that is worth protecting?
Who do I want to protect it from?
How likely is it that I will need to protect it?
How bad are the consequences if I fail?
How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these consequences?

I would like us to start looking into hashing our passwords. Creating a standard length to ensure that our users will have to chose a password hard enough to crack. Offer up two factor Authentication and really push our user to utilize it.
