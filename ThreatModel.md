The security challenge is a little different - you won't be writing code.
Instead, you'll be thinking about security, practicing your professional
communication skills by writing about a threat model as if you were emailing a
coworker. Then you'll apply what you've learned by improving your own practical
personal security, and again write up what you've done (just to document it, but
a good stretch goal is to make your writing even more polished and publish it as
a blog post).

For both of these, turn it in by commiting a Markdown file with your writing to
your fork of this repository. If you publish elsewhere, please share the link as
well.


# Part 1 - Understand and Communicate a Threat Model

Think of a threat model - a situation with a user (or type of user) and a
context that frames their personal security preferences and situation. Concepts
you should consider (and a few examples of each) include:

- Attack surface (what tech/situation exposes them, e.g. systems they use, places they go)
- Adversaries (who may be interested in compromising their security, e.g. criminals, pranksters)
- Attack vectors (specifically how they may be compromised, e.g. password theft/cracking, surveillance)
- Mitigations (what can be done to reduce the risk, e.g. 2-factor auth, encryption)

Write a summary of the overall situation as if you were going to send it as a
professional email to explain it to a coworker. Please turn in a file
`ThreatModel.md` with 1-2 paragraphs addressing the above concepts in a concise
fashion.

As consumers we trust businesses and corporations with keepin gour information safe and out of the hands of
the bad guys.  Unfortunately we we've seen and heard, time and time again consumers information have been 
accessed through security breaches.
