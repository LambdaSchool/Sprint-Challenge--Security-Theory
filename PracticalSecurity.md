I chose to take the time to turn my two-factor-Authrization for a multitude of applications I use. I also plan on implimenting my own hashing to my future projects passwords. I haven't had to much time to really dive into my own and so I like that I have questions to remember to ask myself along the way. Such as the ones I used as examples in my ThreatModel.md file. I need to also remember to read the access requirements they are asking when I am downloading anything onto my personal devices.
