In order to set up a more secure environment on my machine I took the following precautions. Set up a password manager. Got rid of cookies and other history in my browers. Updated my system. Set up two factor identificatoin on my applications, phone, and other accounts. Stored those passwords in my manager. Masked my internet with a vpn service. I plan to pursue more options to gridiron my system. I am looking forward to hardening my system pass the factory configurations.
