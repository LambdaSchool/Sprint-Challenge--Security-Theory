# Practical Security

Concrete steps I took to improve my security online:

1. I decided to sign up to a Password Manager. I chose Dashlane since it's free, but I'm also considering LastPass.
2. I used Secure Socket Shell (SSH ) for GitHub via Visual Studio Code. 
3. I used a "passphrase" as opposed to a mere "password" or "passcode". My passphrase is exactly that - a very long phrase or sentence that is not likely to be hacked by anyone who doesn't possess mind-reading powers.
