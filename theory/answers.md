## Find regexes that match the following. (e.g. find a single regex that matches
both `antelope` and `antelopes`.)

# Single regex that matches either of these: 

    antelope rocks out
    antelopes rock out


* /antelopes? rocks? out/g 

(antelope matches the characters antelope literally s? suggests that the s is optional )
## Regex that matches either of: 

    goat
    moat

  but not:

    boat

* /[^b]oat/g
(this is taking the option of any word ending in oat to not be boat by removing the b from the matching possiblities)
## Regex that matches dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Year can be 1-4 digits, and
  month and day can each be 1-2 digits). This does not need to verify the date
  is correct (e.g 33333-33-33 can match).

  2000-10-12
  1999-1-20
  1999-01-20
  812-2-10

* \d\d?\d?\d?-\d\d?-\d\d?
(any digits with any digit being optional separated by - )



## Draw a state machine that corresponds to the following regex:

      ab*c+d?[ef]

  Remember the Îµ transition can be used to move between states without
  consuming input.

## A lion can be sleeping, eating, hunting, or preening. Draw a state
  machine diagram for the lion and label the transition events that
  cause state transitions.

##       ESC[12;45f

  moves the cursor to line 12, column 45.

  * ESC[1m

  changes the font to bold.

  Come up with regexes for the two above sequences. The one to set the
    cursor position should accept any digits for the row and column. The
    bold sequence need only accept `1` (and is a trivial regex). (ESC is
    a single character which can be represented with `\e` in the regex.)

  * /ESC\[\d+;d+f/g
  * /ESC\[1m/g
